
Meanwhile 
Cyllenian 
Hermes was summoning the ghosts of the 
Suitors . in his hands he held his lovely golden wand with which he can lull men�s eyelids or wake them from sleep : and with this wand he called the ghosts and led them , and 
they followed him gibbering . 
Like bats that flit about and gibber in the depths of an eerie cave , after one falls from the hanging cluster where 
they cling to the rock and one another , so 
they went gibbering behind 
Hermes the 
Helper , down the dank way . past Ocean�s stream , and the 
White rock , past the 
Gates of the 
Sun and the place of dreams , 
they soon reached the meadows of asphodel where the ghosts abide , the phantoms of men whose work is done . / 
Here 
they met with the ghost of 
Achilles , Peleus� son , and that of 
Patroclus , of flawless Antilochus , and ajax whose form and beauty were greatest of the 
Danaans , except for the matchless son of Peleus . 
And these crowded around 
Achilles . 
Then the sad ghost of 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son , drew near and round him thronged others : the ghosts of all those who met their fate and 
died with him in Aegisthus� house . 
And the ghost of 
Achilles spoke first to him , saying : �Son of 
Atreus , 
we always thought you , above all others , were ever dear to 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , being the head of our army on the fields of 
Troy , where 
we 
Achaeans suffered . but it seems you too were doomed to an early death : death that none of all who are born evade . 
How much better it would have been if you�d been fated to die at 
Troy , still enjoying the honour you commanded ! 
Then the whole 
Achaean host would have built your tomb , and increased your son�s glory in future days : but 
now 
we know it was your fate to meet a pitiful death . � / 
And the ghost of Atreus� son replied : �Godlike 
Achilles , son of Peleus , happy to have 
died far away from 
Argos at 
Troy , where round you those others , the best of 
Trojans and 
Achaeans were killed , fighting for your corpse , while you in all your greatness lay there in the 
dust , your horsemanship forgotten . All day long 
we fought , and would never have ceased , if 
Zeus had not stopped us with a mighty storm . After 
we carried you out of the ranks and back to the ships , 
we laid you on a bier and bathed your flesh with warm water and unguents . 
Many were the hot tears the 
Danaans shed over you , many the locks of your hair 
they cut . / 
And out of the sea came your mother , 
Thetis , on hearing the news , with her immortal nymphs , and a miraculous cry echoed over the deep , and made all the 
Achaeans tremble . 
Then 
they wanted to leap up and run to the hollow ships , but 
Nestor , a man wise in ancient wisdom , whose counsel had often prevailed , held them back . 
With good intentions he called to them , saying : �Stop , you 
Argives . 
Achaean youths stand fast ! 
This is his mother come from the sea with her immortal nymphs to gaze on her dead son�s face . � / Bk  : Agamemnon�s ghost tells of the funeral of 
Achilles / 
At his words the brave 
Achaeans checked their flight . 
The daughters of the 
Old man of the Sea stood around your corpse lamenting bitterly . 
They wrapped your body in an imperishable shroud . 
And the nine muses chanted your dirge , responding each to each in their sweet voices . 
There was not a single 
Argive to be seen without tears in his eyes , so moving was the clear song of the muse . Immortal gods and mortal men , 
we mourned for you , seventeen days and nights , and on the eighteenth 
we delivered you to the flames , sacrificing herds of fatted sheep and spiral-horned cattle round you . 
You were burnt clothed as a god , drowned in unguents and sweet honey , and a host of 
Achaean heroes streamed past your pyre as you burned , warriors and charioteers , making a vast noise . 
And at dawn , 
Achilles , when Hephaestus� fires had eaten you , 
we gathered up your whitened ash and bone , and steeped them in oil and unmixed wine . Your mother gave us a gold two-handled urn , saying it was the gift of 
Dionysus , and crafted by far-famed 
Hephaestus himself . 
There your ashes lie , my glorious 
Achilles , mixed with the bones of the dead 
Patroclus , Menoetius� son , but separated from those of Antilochus , who next to dead 
Patroclus you loved most among your comrades . 
And on a headland thrusting into the wide Hellespont 
we , the great host of 
Argive spearmen , heaped a vast flawless mound above them , so it might be seen far out to sea by men who live 
now and those to come . / 
Then your mother set out beautiful prizes she had begged from the gods , in the middle of the arena , to award to the best of the 
Achaeans . 
You were present yourself at the funeral games for royal heroes , when young men gird their loins and try to win the prizes , but even you would have wondered at the sight , such lovely prizes 
Thetis , the silver-footed goddess , set out in your honour : for you were the beloved of the gods . 
So your name was not lost , 
Achilles , in death , and you will be famous indeed forever among men . as for me what pleasure 
should I take in having wound up the skein of war ? 
When I returned , 
Zeus had planned a bitter end for me at the hands of 
Aegisthus and my accursed wife . � / Bk  : Amphimedon�s ghost relates the fate of the 
Suitors / 
So 
they talked , while the messenger god , 
Hermes , slayer of argus , 
approached , leading the ghosts of the 
Suitors 
Odysseus had killed down to 
Hades . 
Astonished at the sight , the two went straight towards them . 
The ghost of 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son recognised noble 
Amphimedon , the brave son of 
Melaneus , who had played host to him at his home in Ithaca . 
The ghost of Atreus� son was first to speak : �Amphimedon what disaster sends you all under the dark earth , choice men , and of an age ? if one picked the best men from a 
city 
they would be like you . 
Did 
Poseidon raise cruel winds and tall waves and overwhelm your ships ? or perhaps your enemies slew you when you tried to cut out their cattle and fine flocks , or when 
they fought to defend their towns and women ? tell me : I am a friend to your house , I swear . 
Surely you remember when I visited your home , I and godlike 
Menelaus , to urge 
Odysseus to sail with us in the oared ships to ilium ? a whole month it took us to cross the open sea , and a hard task it was to win 
Odysseus , sacker of cities , to our cause . � / 
The ghost of 
Amphimedon replied : �Agamemnon , son of 
Atreus , glorious king of men , I remember all of it , favourite of 
Zeus , as you say : and I will you tell truly how 
we came to a bitter end . 
We courted Odysseus� wife , he being long away , and she would neither refuse the marriage she detested nor bring things to a conclusion , instead she planned a dark fate for us , and contrived a cunning scheme in her heart . She set up a great web on her loom in the palace , and began to weave a wide fabric with fine thread . She said this to us too : �My lords , my 
Suitors , though 
Odysseus is dead and you are eager for me to marry , have patience till I complete this work , I do not want it wasted , this shroud for noble 
Laertes , ready for when pitiless death�s cruel end overtakes him : since I fear some 
Achaean woman of this land would blame me , if he who won great wealth lay there without a shroud . � / 
So she spoke , and though proud 
we agreed . 
Then day after day she wove the great web , but at night , by torchlight , she unmade it . 
So for three years she cunningly kept us 
Achaeans from knowing , and so tricked us . but when the fourth year began , as the seasons rolled by , and the months passed , and the endless days ran their course one of her women who was in the know told us all , and 
we caught her in the act of unravelling her weaving . 
So unwillingly she was forced to finish the web . / No sooner had she shown us the robe complete , woven and washed and gleaming like sun or moon , than some malign god brought 
Odysseus from wherever it might be to the shore of the island where the swineherd lived . 
And divine Odysseus� brave son landed there too from his black ship , on his return from sandy 
Pylos , and after plotting a cruel death for us 
Suitors 
they both made their way to Ithaca�s famous 
city , 
Telemachus first with 
Odysseus following later . 
The swineherd brought his master along , dressed in rags , looking the image of an 
old , wretched beggar , leaning on his staff . 
He was so miserably dressed that when he suddenly arrived none of us knew it was he , not even the elders . quite the opposite : 
we pelted him with missiles and evil words . but he , with his brave heart , endured being pelted and mocked in his own palace , until at last aegis-bearing 
Zeus willed him to stir . 
He and 
Telemachus took all the fine weapons , piled them up in the storeroom and bolted the door . 
Then he cunningly told his wife to place his bow and the iron-ringed axes in front of the 
Suitors , and set a test for us ill-fated youths , that led to our deaths . / none of us could string the great bow : 
we fell far short of that . 
When the powerful weapon reached 
Odysseus , 
we all demanded it not be given into his hands , however much he desired it . 
Telemachus alone urged him on , telling him to take it . 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus grasped it firmly , strung it easily , and fired an arrow through the iron rings . 
He moved to the threshold , and standing there , glowering fiercely , he poured out a stream of swift shafts , and so killed lord 
Antinous . After that he let his well-aimed darts , death-dealers , fly at the rest of us , and men fell thick and fast . It was clear that some god was on their side : because , in a moment , 
they had charged through the hall in their fury , slaying men left and right . as 
they struck at our heads , a hideous groaning ensued , and the floor swam with blood . / 
So 
we 
died , 
Agamemnon , and our bodies still lie uncared-for in Odysseus� great hall since the news has not yet reached our homes and summoned our friends to wash the black blood from our wounds , and lay out or bodies , grieving as befits the dead . � / 
Then the ghost of Atreus� son cried out : �Odysseus , son of 
Laertes , how resourceful , and how truly fortunate to have won so excellent a wife . 
What depth of wisdom there is in flawless 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter ! 
How faithfully she kept her husband�s image in her mind ! 
So the glory of her excellence will not fade , instead the gods will create a song of delight for mortal ears , in honour of loyal 
Penelope . 
How different the ways of 
Clytaemnestra , Tyndareus� daughter , plotting evil , murdering her husband . 
Her tale will be a hateful one to mankind , and she brought odium on her sex , even those of them who do right . � / 
So , these two spoke together : where 
they stood , in the house of 
Hades deep under the earth . / Bk  : 
Odysseus finds 
Laertes / 
Now 
Odysseus and his comrades had left the town , and had soon come to Laertes� rich and well-run farm , that he had won for himself with great effort long ago . 
The farmhouse was surrounded by buildings where the slaves who laboured for him sat and ate , and took their rest . a kind 
old 
Sicilian woman cared for the aged man , there on his farm far from the town . / once there 
Odysseus said to his servants and son : �Go into the farmstead and kill the best pig you can find for our meal . 
Meanwhile I�ll go and see if my father recognises me on sight or not , since I�ve been so long away . � / 
With this he handed his armour to his men , and 
they went off to the farm , but 
Odysseus 
approached the fertile vineyard to test his father . as he went through the great orchard he failed to come across 
Dolius , his sons , or his slaves , since as it happened that led by the 
old man 
they had gone to 
gather stone for the vineyard wall . 
So he found his father alone in the well-tended vineyard , hoeing round a vine , and nursing his sorrows . 
He was dressed in a wretched filthy patched tunic , with a pair of stitched ox-hide leggings strapped round his shins to avoid scratches , gloves on his hands to protect against thorns , and a goatskin cap on his head . 
When noble long-suffering 
Odysseus saw how 
old and worn and burdened with grief he looked , he halted under a tall pear-tree , tears in his eyes . 
He debated in heart and mind whether to clasp his father to him with kisses , and tell him the whole story of his return home , or whether to make trial of him with questions . on reflection he thought the latter was best , to try him with testing words . 
So with this in mind , noble 
Odysseus went straight up to him . His father had his head down , hoeing the vines , as his glorious son 
approached him , saying : �Old man , you show no lack of skill in your gardening : in fact you care for it all so well there�s nothing , fig , vine , olive , pear , no planted patch in the whole field that lacks attention . but don�t be offended if I say that you yourself are uncared for : you suffer a sad 
old age , unkempt and dressed in rags . It can�t be laziness that makes your master neglect you , and you don�t look like a slave in form or manner . 
You seem more like royalty , like a man who when he has had his bath and dined , 
should sleep on a soft bed , as indeed 
old men 
should . but tell me this in truth , whose slave are you , and whose land do you tend ? 
And tell me in truth as well whether this is really Ithaca I have reached , as someone I met on the way here said just 
now ? 
He was somewhat obtuse , since he couldn�t bring himself to listen or give me a proper answer when I asked after a friend . I want to know if 
Odysseus is still alive , or has gone to Hades� house . / I�ll ask you again , please listen and reflect . I once entertained a guest , in my own land , and never a far-travelled stranger was more welcome . 
He said that he was born in Ithaca : and that his father was 
Laertes , Arceisius� son . 
So I took him to the house and treated him well and with kindness to the rich stores I had , giving him fitting tokens of friendship . 
There were seven talents of finely wrought gold , a silver mixing bowl embossed with flowers , twelve singly-folded cloaks , and as many robes and tunics and coverlets , as well as four fine women skilled in perfect handiwork , whom he chose himself . � / �Stranger , � 
Laertes answered , weeping , �you have indeed reached the country you said , but it�s in the hands of wild and reckless men . 
You gave those countless gifts in vain , though if you had found him alive in Ithaca he would have entertained you equally with good cheer , and sent you onwards with ample gifts , as is due in return for a kindness first offered . but tell me truly how long ago you entertained my son , that unlucky guest � if indeed he can ever have existed � my poor son , whom the deep-sea fish have eaten , or who has become a prey to birds and beasts on some far-flung shore . I and his mother who bore him had no chance to wrap him in his shroud and lament for him . Nor was his wife , faithful 
Penelope , whom he wooed with many a gift , allowed to weep for her husband on his bier after closing his eyes , though that is owed the dead . / tell me though , truly , about yourself , so I may know who you are , and where you hail from . 
Where is your 
city , and who are your parents ? 
Where is the swift ship moored that brought you and your godlike comrades here ? or were you a passenger on board , and did it sail on when you had landed ? � / Bk  : 
Odysseus makes himself known to 
Laertes / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus replied : �I will tell you all , quite openly . I hail from 
Alybas , and my house is famous . I am the son of 
Apheidas , lord Polypemon�s son , and I am called Eperitus . a god drove me here , from 
Sicania , against my wishes , and my ship is anchored opposite the fields some way from the town . as for 
Odysseus , it is five years since that ill-fated man left my country . 
Though when he left the omens were good , birds flying from the right . I was glad to see them at parting , and he too , as he boarded ship , and our hearts were full , hoping to meet again as guest and host , and exchange glorious gifts . � / 
So he spoke , and 
Laertes was enveloped by a dark cloud of sorrow . Groaning heavily , he filled his hands with black 
dust and poured it over his grey head . 
Then Odysseus� heart was deeply moved , and gazing at his dear father pain filled his nostrils . 
He rushed forward , caught him in his arms , and kissed him , saying : �Father , it is I . I am the man you asked about , home in my ancestral land in the twentieth year . No more sorrow , no more tears of grief . I have things to tell you , and there is little time . I have killed every 
Suitor in the palace , in revenge for their crimes and their outrageous insults . � / �If you are indeed 
Odysseus , my son , �Laertes replied , �give me some proof of it that will convince me . � / �See this scar first , � resourceful 
Odysseus answered , �dealt by the white tusk of a wild boar when I hunted on Parnassus . 
You and my dear mother had sent me to her father 
Autolycus to secure the gifts he had promised when he came to visit us . 
And then , I can list the trees in our fine garden you once gave me . I was just a child and I follo
wed you through the orchard asking about this and that . as we walked through these very trees you named them and told me about each kind . Thirteen pear trees you gave me , ten apple-trees and forty figs . 
And you promised me fifty rows of vines , ripening at intervals , weighed down by the various bunches of grapes in Zeus� season . � / 
At this , 
Laertes knees grew weak , and his heart melted , knowing the true tokens 
Odysseus offered . 
He flung his arms round his dear son�s neck , and noble long-suffering 
Odysseus caught him as he fainted . 
When life and consciousness returned he spoke to his son , saying : �Truly , 
Father 
Zeus , if the 
Suitors have paid the price for their wanton damage , you gods have power still on high Olympus . but I fear greatly that the men of Ithaca will soon be upon us . 
They will send for help to all the towns of Cephallenia too . � / Bk  : 
Dolius recognises 
Odysseus / �Take courage , � resourceful 
Odysseus answered , �and don�t let that distress you . Let�s go through the orchard to the farmhouse , since I sent 
Telemachus and the cowherd and swineherd there , to prepare food for us all as quickly as possible . � / 
So 
they spoke and walked to the fine farmhouse , where 
they found 
Telemachus and the cowherd and swineherd carving meat , and mixing the glowing wine . / 
There , great-hearted 
Laertes was bathed by his 
Sicilian maid , and rubbed with oil , and she wrapped him in a fine cloak . 
Then 
Athene 
approached and filled out his limbs , and made the shepherd of his people look taller and stronger . 
He came from the bath and his dear son wondered at his godlike appearance , and he spoke to him winged words : �Father , surely an immortal god has made you seem taller and more handsome . � / 
Wise 
Laertes replied : �By 
Father 
Zeus , 
Athene and 
Apollo , I wish I�d been standing by your side yesterday in the palace , armour on my back , and driven off the 
Suitors with the strength I had when I ruled the 
Cephallenians and captured 
Nericus that great citadel on the mainland coast . I�d have loosened their knees , then , in the hall , and gladdened your heart ! � / 
So 
they talked , while the others finished their work of preparing a meal . 
Then 
they sat round on chairs and stools , helping themselves to the food , when 
old 
Dolius and his sons arrived , tired from their labour in the fields . 
The 
old 
Sicilian woman , their mother , had gone to call them , she who made their meals and looked after the 
old man in her kindness , 
now 
old age had gripped him . 
When 
they saw 
Odysseus , 
they recognised him , and stood there lost in wonder . but 
Odysseus spoke to them pleasantly , saying : �Sit down to dinner 
old man , all of you , and stop looking so amazed . We�ve been waiting for you to arrive for ages , despite our desire to eat . � / 
At this , 
Dolius rushed towards him with open arms , grasped Odysseus� hand , kissing him on the wrist , and his words had wings : �Dear master , you return to us . 
We longed for you , but never thought to see you again . Welcome to you , greetings : the gods themselves have brought you back , and may 
they grant you joy . but tell me this , for certain , does wise 
Penelope know you are home , or shall 
we send to tell her ? � / �Old man , � said resourceful 
Odysseus , �she knows already , you need not trouble . 
At this , 
Dolius sat down on a polished bench , while his sons crowded round glorious 
Odysseus , greeting him and grasping his hands . 
Then 
they too sat down next to their father . / Bk  : 
The 
Ithacans 
gather / 
While 
they were busy eating , 
Rumour , the messenger , flew through the town with news of the Suitors� dreadful fate . 
Wailing and grieving the people gathered in front of Odysseus� palace , as soon as 
they heard . 
They brought out their dead , and carried them away for burial . Those who had been from foreign parts 
they sent home on swift ships with a full crew then 
they made their way to the meeting-place . 
When all had gathered , 
Eupeithes rose , and spoke , his heart heavy with inconsolable sorrow for his own son , 
Antinous , the first to die at noble Odysseus� hands . 
With tears in his eyes he addressed the assembly : �Friends , this man has done terrible things to us 
Achaeans . 
He took many brave men with him aboard his ships , and lost every vessel and their men . 
Now he has killed more , among them the best of the 
Cephallenians . 
Come , let us act , before he runs for 
Pylos or noble 
Elis , where the Epeians rule , or 
we will be ashamed forever . 
Unless 
we avenge the deaths of our brothers and sons , 
we shall be disgraced in the eyes of posterity . I would take no delight in being alive : I would rather end it at once , and go to join the dead . let us make a move before 
they flee overseas . � / 
He spoke and wept , and the 
Achaeans pitied him . 
Then 
Medon and the divine bard appeared , having just woken in Odysseus� palace . All wondered as 
they took their stand in the centre . 
Medon , the wise , spoke , saying : �Hear me , men of Ithaca . 
Odysseus has not worked all this without the immortal gods willing it . I saw a deathless one stand at Odysseus� side , in the very likeness of mentor . 
Now the divine one went before him , 
now raged through the hall , terrifying the 
Suitors while 
they fell thick and fast . � / 
At his words 
they all grew pale with fear . 
Then the 
old hero 
Halitherses , Mastor�s son , who alone saw past and future , addressed them with good intent , saying : �Listen 
now , 
Ithacans , to my words . 
These things have happened through your own reluctance . 
You wouldn�t listen to me or mentor , he an elder of the people , and put a stop to your sons� foolishness . 
Claiming he would not return , 
they wasted the king�s goods , and failed to honour his wife , a disgrace brought about by blind and sinful recklessness . 
Now listen to what I say and act accordingly . let us make no move , in case 
we bring disaster on ourselves . � / Bk  : 
Athene questions 
Zeus / 
When he had finished speaking some remained in their seats , but the majority rose with loud cries , and rushed for their weapons , rejecting his speech , persuaded by 
Eupeithes . 
When 
they had donned the gleaming bronze , 
they gathered in a crowd in front of the spacious town . 
Eupeithes foolishly led them , thinking to avenge his son�s death , but he was doomed himself not to return alive . / 
Now 
Athene spoke to 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , saying : �Son of 
Cronos , 
Father of us all , lord of lords , tell me , I beg you , what is your secret intent ? 
Will you encourage vile war and the terrible din of battle , or will you make peace between these two opponents ? � / 
And 
Zeus the 
Cloud-Gatherer replied : �My child , why ask me ? Wasn�t it you who invented this plan , for 
Odysseus to exact vengeance when he returned ? do as you wish , but I will tell you what is right . 
Now noble 
Odysseus has exacted revenge , let them swear a solemn oath that he shall be king till he dies , and let us help the memory of their sons� and brothers� deaths to fade . let them love one another as before , and let peace and plenty hold sway . � 
And his words spurred the eager 
Athene to swoop down from the heights of Olympus . / 
Meanwhile noble long-suffering 
Odysseus began to speak , 
now 
they had sated themselves with the pleasant meal , saying : �Someone 
should go and find out if 
they are closing in on us . � / 
At this command , one of Dolius� sons went out , and standing on the threshold he saw them nearby , and spoke winged words to 
Odysseus : �Quick , to arms , 
they are here already . � / 
They rose at his words and donned their armour . 
Odysseus and his comrades made four , and the sons of 
Dolius were six , and 
Laertes and 
Dolius wore their armour too , forced to fight despite their grey hairs . 
When 
they had all protected their bodies with gleaming bronze 
they opened the doors and ran out , 
Odysseus in the lead . / Bk  : 
Athene brings peace / 
Now 
Athene , Zeus� daughter , 
approached them , in the form and with the voice of mentor , and noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was overjoyed to see her , and spoke instantly to his brave son 
Telemachus : �Telemachus , 
now you have come to a place where the battle shows who is bravest do not disgrace your ancestors� house . 
We have always been first in strength and courage . � / �Dear father , � wise 
Telemachus replied , �in the mood I am in , you shall see me , as you say and wish , bring no disgrace to our lineage . � 
So he declared , and 
Laertes was pleased , and said : �What a day this is for me , dear gods ! I am all joy to see my son and grandson argue as to who is bravest . � / 
Then bright-eyed 
Athene 
approached him , saying : �Son of 
Arceisius , dearest of all my friends , pray to the bright-eyed maiden and 
Father 
Zeus , then raise high your long spear as you finish , and throw hard . � 
With this , while he prayed to the daughter of 
Zeus , she breathed great power into him . 
He raised his long spear high as he finished and threw , striking 
Eupeithes on the bronze-guarded helmet . 
The spear was not deflected , however , and travelled right through . 
Eupeithes fell with a thud and a clang of armour . 
Then 
Odysseus and his glorious son attacked the leading men , thrusting at them with their swords and double-edged spear-blades . 
They would have killed the lot , and ended their hopes of returning home , if 
Athene , Zeus� aegis-bearing daughter , had not shouted loudly , and restrained the combatants , crying : �Men of Ithaca , cease your fight , so that you may part without shedding each others� blood . � / 
They grew pale with fear at Athene�s call . 
The weapons flew from their hands in their terror , and fell to the ground , as 
they turned towards the town , eager to save their lives , eager to fly from the voice of the goddess . 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus gave a chilling cry , and gathering himself he swooped on them , like an eagle from the heights , just as 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , let fly a gleaming lightning bolt that fell at the feet of the bright-eyed daughter of that mighty 
Father . 
And bright-eyed 
Athene said to 
Odysseus : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes hold back your hand and stop this warring among you , lest 
Zeus the 
Thunderer grows angry . � / 
Odysseus 
obeyed Athene�s words , delighted at heart . 
Then 
Pallas 
Athene , Zeus� aegis-bearing daughter , in the form and with the voice of mentor , forged a solemn truce between the warring sides . / 
Meanwhile 
Cyllenian 
Hermes was summoning the ghosts of the 
Suitors . in his hands he held his lovely golden wand with which he can lull men�s eyelids or wake them from sleep : and with this wand he called the ghosts and led them , and 
they followed him gibbering . 
Like bats that flit about and gibber in the depths of an eerie cave , after one falls from the hanging cluster where 
they cling to the rock and one another , so 
they went gibbering behind 
Hermes the 
Helper , down the dank way . past Ocean�s stream , and the 
White rock , past the 
Gates of the 
Sun and the place of dreams , 
they soon reached the meadows of asphodel where the ghosts abide , the phantoms of men whose work is done . / 
Here 
they met with the ghost of 
Achilles , Peleus� son , and that of 
Patroclus , of flawless Antilochus , and ajax whose form and beauty were greatest of the 
Danaans , except for the matchless son of Peleus . 
And these crowded around 
Achilles . 
Then the sad ghost of 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son , drew near and round him thronged others : the ghosts of all those who met their fate and 
died with him in Aegisthus� house . 
And the ghost of 
Achilles spoke first to him , saying : �Son of 
Atreus , 
we always thought you , above all others , were ever dear to 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , being the head of our army on the fields of 
Troy , where 
we 
Achaeans suffered . but it seems you too were doomed to an early death : death that none of all who are born evade . 
How much better it would have been if you�d been fated to die at 
Troy , still enjoying the honour you commanded ! 
Then the whole 
Achaean host would have built your tomb , and increased your son�s glory in future days : but 
now 
we know it was your fate to meet a pitiful death . � / 
And the ghost of Atreus� son replied : �Godlike 
Achilles , son of Peleus , happy to have 
died far away from 
Argos at 
Troy , where round you those others , the best of 
Trojans and 
Achaeans were killed , fighting for your corpse , while you in all your greatness lay there in the 
dust , your horsemanship forgotten . All day long 
we fought , and would never have ceased , if 
Zeus had not stopped us with a mighty storm . After 
we carried you out of the ranks and back to the ships , 
we laid you on a bier and bathed your flesh with warm water and unguents . 
Many were the hot tears the 
Danaans shed over you , many the locks of your hair 
they cut . / 
And out of the sea came your mother , 
Thetis , on hearing the news , with her immortal nymphs , and a miraculous cry echoed over the deep , and made all the 
Achaeans tremble . 
Then 
they wanted to leap up and run to the hollow ships , but 
Nestor , a man wise in ancient wisdom , whose counsel had often prevailed , held them back . 
With good intentions he called to them , saying : �Stop , you 
Argives . 
Achaean youths stand fast ! 
This is his mother come from the sea with her immortal nymphs to gaze on her dead son�s face . � / Bk  : Agamemnon�s ghost tells of the funeral of 
Achilles / 
At his words the brave 
Achaeans checked their flight . 
The daughters of the 
Old man of the Sea stood around your corpse lamenting bitterly . 
They wrapped your body in an imperishable shroud . 
And the nine muses chanted your dirge , responding each to each in their sweet voices . 
There was not a single 
Argive to be seen without tears in his eyes , so moving was the clear song of the muse . Immortal gods and mortal men , 
we mourned for you , seventeen days and nights , and on the eighteenth 
we delivered you to the flames , sacrificing herds of fatted sheep and spiral-horned cattle round you . 
You were burnt clothed as a god , drowned in unguents and sweet honey , and a host of 
Achaean heroes streamed past your pyre as you burned , warriors and charioteers , making a vast noise . 
And at dawn , 
Achilles , when Hephaestus� fires had eaten you , 
we gathered up your whitened ash and bone , and steeped them in oil and unmixed wine . Your mother gave us a gold two-handled urn , saying it was the gift of 
Dionysus , and crafted by far-famed 
Hephaestus himself . 
There your ashes lie , my glorious 
Achilles , mixed with the bones of the dead 
Patroclus , Menoetius� son , but separated from those of Antilochus , who next to dead 
Patroclus you loved most among your comrades . 
And on a headland thrusting into the wide Hellespont 
we , the great host of 
Argive spearmen , heaped a vast flawless mound above them , so it might be seen far out to sea by men who live 
now and those to come . / 
Then your mother set out beautiful prizes she had begged from the gods , in the middle of the arena , to award to the best of the 
Achaeans . 
You were present yourself at the funeral games for royal heroes , when young men gird their loins and try to win the prizes , but even you would have wondered at the sight , such lovely prizes 
Thetis , the silver-footed goddess , set out in your honour : for you were the beloved of the gods . 
So your name was not lost , 
Achilles , in death , and you will be famous indeed forever among men . as for me what pleasure 
should I take in having wound up the skein of war ? 
When I returned , 
Zeus had planned a bitter end for me at the hands of 
Aegisthus and my accursed wife . � / Bk  : Amphimedon�s ghost relates the fate of the 
Suitors / 
So 
they talked , while the messenger god , 
Hermes , slayer of argus , 
approached , leading the ghosts of the 
Suitors 
Odysseus had killed down to 
Hades . 
Astonished at the sight , the two went straight towards them . 
The ghost of 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son recognised noble 
Amphimedon , the brave son of 
Melaneus , who had played host to him at his home in Ithaca . 
The ghost of Atreus� son was first to speak : �Amphimedon what disaster sends you all under the dark earth , choice men , and of an age ? if one picked the best men from a 
city 
they would be like you . 
Did 
Poseidon raise cruel winds and tall waves and overwhelm your ships ? or perhaps your enemies slew you when you tried to cut out their cattle and fine flocks , or when 
they fought to defend their towns and women ? tell me : I am a friend to your house , I swear . 
Surely you remember when I visited your home , I and godlike 
Menelaus , to urge 
Odysseus to sail with us in the oared ships to ilium ? a whole month it took us to cross the open sea , and a hard task it was to win 
Odysseus , sacker of cities , to our cause . � / 
The ghost of 
Amphimedon replied : �Agamemnon , son of 
Atreus , glorious king of men , I remember all of it , favourite of 
Zeus , as you say : and I will you tell truly how 
we came to a bitter end . 
We courted Odysseus� wife , he being long away , and she would neither refuse the marriage she detested nor bring things to a conclusion , instead she planned a dark fate for us , and contrived a cunning scheme in her heart . She set up a great web on her loom in the palace , and began to weave a wide fabric with fine thread . She said this to us too : �My lords , my 
Suitors , though 
Odysseus is dead and you are eager for me to marry , have patience till I complete this work , I do not want it wasted , this shroud for noble 
Laertes , ready for when pitiless death�s cruel end overtakes him : since I fear some 
Achaean woman of this land would blame me , if he who won great wealth lay there without a shroud . � / 
So she spoke , and though proud 
we agreed . 
Then day after day she wove the great web , but at night , by torchlight , she unmade it . 
So for three years she cunningly kept us 
Achaeans from knowing , and so tricked us . but when the fourth year began , as the seasons rolled by , and the months passed , and the endless days ran their course one of her women who was in the know told us all , and 
we caught her in the act of unravelling her weaving . 
So unwillingly she was forced to finish the web . / No sooner had she shown us the robe complete , woven and washed and gleaming like sun or moon , than some malign god brought 
Odysseus from wherever it might be to the shore of the island where the swineherd lived . 
And divine Odysseus� brave son landed there too from his black ship , on his return from sandy 
Pylos , and after plotting a cruel death for us 
Suitors 
they both made their way to Ithaca�s famous 
city , 
Telemachus first with 
Odysseus following later . 
The swineherd brought his master along , dressed in rags , looking the image of an 
old , wretched beggar , leaning on his staff . 
He was so miserably dressed that when he suddenly arrived none of us knew it was he , not even the elders . quite the opposite : 
we pelted him with missiles and evil words . but he , with his brave heart , endured being pelted and mocked in his own palace , until at last aegis-bearing 
Zeus willed him to stir . 
He and 
Telemachus took all the fine weapons , piled them up in the storeroom and bolted the door . 
Then he cunningly told his wife to place his bow and the iron-ringed axes in front of the 
Suitors , and set a test for us ill-fated youths , that led to our deaths . / none of us could string the great bow : 
we fell far short of that . 
When the powerful weapon reached 
Odysseus , 
we all demanded it not be given into his hands , however much he desired it . 
Telemachus alone urged him on , telling him to take it . 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus grasped it firmly , strung it easily , and fired an arrow through the iron rings . 
He moved to the threshold , and standing there , glowering fiercely , he poured out a stream of swift shafts , and so killed lord 
Antinous . After that he let his well-aimed darts , death-dealers , fly at the rest of us , and men fell thick and fast . It was clear that some god was on their side : because , in a moment , 
they had charged through the hall in their fury , slaying men left and right . as 
they struck at our heads , a hideous groaning ensued , and the floor swam with blood . / 
So 
we 
died , 
Agamemnon , and our bodies still lie uncared-for in Odysseus� great hall since the news has not yet reached our homes and summoned our friends to wash the black blood from our wounds , and lay out or bodies , grieving as befits the dead . � / 
Then the ghost of Atreus� son cried out : �Odysseus , son of 
Laertes , how resourceful , and how truly fortunate to have won so excellent a wife . 
What depth of wisdom there is in flawless 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter ! 
How faithfully she kept her husband�s image in her mind ! 
So the glory of her excellence will not fade , instead the gods will create a song of delight for mortal ears , in honour of loyal 
Penelope . 
How different the ways of 
Clytaemnestra , Tyndareus� daughter , plotting evil , murdering her husband . 
Her tale will be a hateful one to mankind , and she brought odium on her sex , even those of them who do right . � / 
So , these two spoke together : where 
they stood , in the house of 
Hades deep under the earth . / Bk  : 
Odysseus finds 
Laertes / 
Now 
Odysseus and his comrades had left the town , and had soon come to Laertes� rich and well-run farm , that he had won for himself with great effort long ago . 
The farmhouse was surrounded by buildings where the slaves who laboured for him sat and ate , and took their rest . a kind 
old 
Sicilian woman cared for the aged man , there on his farm far from the town . / once there 
Odysseus said to his servants and son : �Go into the farmstead and kill the best pig you can find for our meal . 
Meanwhile I�ll go and see if my father recognises me on sight or not , since I�ve been so long away . � / 
With this he handed his armour to his men , and 
they went off to the farm , but 
Odysseus 
approached the fertile vineyard to test his father . as he went through the great orchard he failed to come across 
Dolius , his sons , or his slaves , since as it happened that led by the 
old man 
they had gone to 
gather stone for the vineyard wall . 
So he found his father alone in the well-tended vineyard , hoeing round a vine , and nursing his sorrows . 
He was dressed in a wretched filthy patched tunic , with a pair of stitched ox-hide leggings strapped round his shins to avoid scratches , gloves on his hands to protect against thorns , and a goatskin cap on his head . 
When noble long-suffering 
Odysseus saw how 
old and worn and burdened with grief he looked , he halted under a tall pear-tree , tears in his eyes . 
He debated in heart and mind whether to clasp his father to him with kisses , and tell him the whole story of his return home , or whether to make trial of him with questions . on reflection he thought the latter was best , to try him with testing words . 
So with this in mind , noble 
Odysseus went straight up to him . His father had his head down , hoeing the vines , as his glorious son 
approached him , saying : �Old man , you show no lack of skill in your gardening : in fact you care for it all so well there�s nothing , fig , vine , olive , pear , no planted patch in the whole field that lacks attention . but don�t be offended if I say that you yourself are uncared for : you suffer a sad 
old age , unkempt and dressed in rags . It can�t be laziness that makes your master neglect you , and you don�t look like a slave in form or manner . 
You seem more like royalty , like a man who when he has had his bath and dined , 
should sleep on a soft bed , as indeed 
old men 
should . but tell me this in truth , whose slave are you , and whose land do you tend ? 
And tell me in truth as well whether this is really Ithaca I have reached , as someone I met on the way here said just 
now ? 
He was somewhat obtuse , since he couldn�t bring himself to listen or give me a proper answer when I asked after a friend . I want to know if 
Odysseus is still alive , or has gone to Hades� house . / I�ll ask you again , please listen and reflect . I once entertained a guest , in my own land , and never a far-travelled stranger was more welcome . 
He said that he was born in Ithaca : and that his father was 
Laertes , Arceisius� son . 
So I took him to the house and treated him well and with kindness to the rich stores I had , giving him fitting tokens of friendship . 
There were seven talents of finely wrought gold , a silver mixing bowl embossed with flowers , twelve singly-folded cloaks , and as many robes and tunics and coverlets , as well as four fine women skilled in perfect handiwork , whom he chose himself . � / �Stranger , � 
Laertes answered , weeping , �you have indeed reached the country you said , but it�s in the hands of wild and reckless men . 
You gave those countless gifts in vain , though if you had found him alive in Ithaca he would have entertained you equally with good cheer , and sent you onwards with ample gifts , as is due in return for a kindness first offered . but tell me truly how long ago you entertained my son , that unlucky guest � if indeed he can ever have existed � my poor son , whom the deep-sea fish have eaten , or who has become a prey to birds and beasts on some far-flung shore . I and his mother who bore him had no chance to wrap him in his shroud and lament for him . Nor was his wife , faithful 
Penelope , whom he wooed with many a gift , allowed to weep for her husband on his bier after closing his eyes , though that is owed the dead . / tell me though , truly , about yourself , so I may know who you are , and where you hail from . 
Where is your 
city , and who are your parents ? 
Where is the swift ship moored that brought you and your godlike comrades here ? or were you a passenger on board , and did it sail on when you had landed ? � / Bk  : 
Odysseus makes himself known to 
Laertes / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus replied : �I will tell you all , quite openly . I hail from 
Alybas , and my house is famous . I am the son of 
Apheidas , lord Polypemon�s son , and I am called Eperitus . a god drove me here , from 
Sicania , against my wishes , and my ship is anchored opposite the fields some way from the town . as for 
Odysseus , it is five years since that ill-fated man left my country . 
Though when he left the omens were good , birds flying from the right . I was glad to see them at parting , and he too , as he boarded ship , and our hearts were full , hoping to meet again as guest and host , and exchange glorious gifts . � / 
So he spoke , and 
Laertes was enveloped by a dark cloud of sorrow . Groaning heavily , he filled his hands with black 
dust and poured it over his grey head . 
Then Odysseus� heart was deeply moved , and gazing at his dear father pain filled his nostrils . 
He rushed forward , caught him in his arms , and kissed him , saying : �Father , it is I . I am the man you asked about , home in my ancestral land in the twentieth year . No more sorrow , no more tears of grief . I have things to tell you , and there is little time . I have killed every 
Suitor in the palace , in revenge for their crimes and their outrageous insults . � / �If you are indeed 
Odysseus , my son , �Laertes replied , �give me some proof of it that will convince me . � / �See this scar first , � resourceful 
Odysseus answered , �dealt by the white tusk of a wild boar when I hunted on Parnassus . 
You and my dear mother had sent me to her father 
Autolycus to secure the gifts he had promised when he came to visit us . 
And then , I can list the trees in our fine garden you once gave me . I was just a child and I follo
wed you through the orchard asking about this and that . as we walked through these very trees you named them and told me about each kind . Thirteen pear trees you gave me , ten apple-trees and forty figs . 
And you promised me fifty rows of vines , ripening at intervals , weighed down by the various bunches of grapes in Zeus� season . � / 
At this , 
Laertes knees grew weak , and his heart melted , knowing the true tokens 
Odysseus offered . 
He flung his arms round his dear son�s neck , and noble long-suffering 
Odysseus caught him as he fainted . 
When life and consciousness returned he spoke to his son , saying : �Truly , 
Father 
Zeus , if the 
Suitors have paid the price for their wanton damage , you gods have power still on high Olympus . but I fear greatly that the men of Ithaca will soon be upon us . 
They will send for help to all the towns of Cephallenia too . � / Bk  : 
Dolius recognises 
Odysseus / �Take courage , � resourceful 
Odysseus answered , �and don�t let that distress you . Let�s go through the orchard to the farmhouse , since I sent 
Telemachus and the cowherd and swineherd there , to prepare food for us all as quickly as possible . � / 
So 
they spoke and walked to the fine farmhouse , where 
they found 
Telemachus and the cowherd and swineherd carving meat , and mixing the glowing wine . / 
There , great-hearted 
Laertes was bathed by his 
Sicilian maid , and rubbed with oil , and she wrapped him in a fine cloak . 
Then 
Athene 
approached and filled out his limbs , and made the shepherd of his people look taller and stronger . 
He came from the bath and his dear son wondered at his godlike appearance , and he spoke to him winged words : �Father , surely an immortal god has made you seem taller and more handsome . � / 
Wise 
Laertes replied : �By 
Father 
Zeus , 
Athene and 
Apollo , I wish I�d been standing by your side yesterday in the palace , armour on my back , and driven off the 
Suitors with the strength I had when I ruled the 
Cephallenians and captured 
Nericus that great citadel on the mainland coast . I�d have loosened their knees , then , in the hall , and gladdened your heart ! � / 
So 
they talked , while the others finished their work of preparing a meal . 
Then 
they sat round on chairs and stools , helping themselves to the food , when 
old 
Dolius and his sons arrived , tired from their labour in the fields . 
The 
old 
Sicilian woman , their mother , had gone to call them , she who made their meals and looked after the 
old man in her kindness , 
now 
old age had gripped him . 
When 
they saw 
Odysseus , 
they recognised him , and stood there lost in wonder . but 
Odysseus spoke to them pleasantly , saying : �Sit down to dinner 
old man , all of you , and stop looking so amazed . We�ve been waiting for you to arrive for ages , despite our desire to eat . � / 
At this , 
Dolius rushed towards him with open arms , grasped Odysseus� hand , kissing him on the wrist , and his words had wings : �Dear master , you return to us . 
We longed for you , but never thought to see you again . Welcome to you , greetings : the gods themselves have brought you back , and may 
they grant you joy . but tell me this , for certain , does wise 
Penelope know you are home , or shall 
we send to tell her ? � / �Old man , � said resourceful 
Odysseus , �she knows already , you need not trouble . 
At this , 
Dolius sat down on a polished bench , while his sons crowded round glorious 
Odysseus , greeting him and grasping his hands . 
Then 
they too sat down next to their father . / Bk  : 
The 
Ithacans 
gather / 
While 
they were busy eating , 
Rumour , the messenger , flew through the town with news of the Suitors� dreadful fate . 
Wailing and grieving the people gathered in front of Odysseus� palace , as soon as 
they heard . 
They brought out their dead , and carried them away for burial . Those who had been from foreign parts 
they sent home on swift ships with a full crew then 
they made their way to the meeting-place . 
When all had gathered , 
Eupeithes rose , and spoke , his heart heavy with inconsolable sorrow for his own son , 
Antinous , the first to die at noble Odysseus� hands . 
With tears in his eyes he addressed the assembly : �Friends , this man has done terrible things to us 
Achaeans . 
He took many brave men with him aboard his ships , and lost every vessel and their men . 
Now he has killed more , among them the best of the 
Cephallenians . 
Come , let us act , before he runs for 
Pylos or noble 
Elis , where the Epeians rule , or 
we will be ashamed forever . 
Unless 
we avenge the deaths of our brothers and sons , 
we shall be disgraced in the eyes of posterity . I would take no delight in being alive : I would rather end it at once , and go to join the dead . let us make a move before 
they flee overseas . � / 
He spoke and wept , and the 
Achaeans pitied him . 
Then 
Medon and the divine bard appeared , having just woken in Odysseus� palace . All wondered as 
they took their stand in the centre . 
Medon , the wise , spoke , saying : �Hear me , men of Ithaca . 
Odysseus has not worked all this without the immortal gods willing it . I saw a deathless one stand at Odysseus� side , in the very likeness of mentor . 
Now the divine one went before him , 
now raged through the hall , terrifying the 
Suitors while 
they fell thick and fast . � / 
At his words 
they all grew pale with fear . 
Then the 
old hero 
Halitherses , Mastor�s son , who alone saw past and future , addressed them with good intent , saying : �Listen 
now , 
Ithacans , to my words . 
These things have happened through your own reluctance . 
You wouldn�t listen to me or mentor , he an elder of the people , and put a stop to your sons� foolishness . 
Claiming he would not return , 
they wasted the king�s goods , and failed to honour his wife , a disgrace brought about by blind and sinful recklessness . 
Now listen to what I say and act accordingly . let us make no move , in case 
we bring disaster on ourselves . � / Bk  : 
Athene questions 
Zeus / 
When he had finished speaking some remained in their seats , but the majority rose with loud cries , and rushed for their weapons , rejecting his speech , persuaded by 
Eupeithes . 
When 
they had donned the gleaming bronze , 
they gathered in a crowd in front of the spacious town . 
Eupeithes foolishly led them , thinking to avenge his son�s death , but he was doomed himself not to return alive . / 
Now 
Athene spoke to 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , saying : �Son of 
Cronos , 
Father of us all , lord of lords , tell me , I beg you , what is your secret intent ? 
Will you encourage vile war and the terrible din of battle , or will you make peace between these two opponents ? � / 
And 
Zeus the 
Cloud-Gatherer replied : �My child , why ask me ? Wasn�t it you who invented this plan , for 
Odysseus to exact vengeance when he returned ? do as you wish , but I will tell you what is right . 
Now noble 
Odysseus has exacted revenge , let them swear a solemn oath that he shall be king till he dies , and let us help the memory of their sons� and brothers� deaths to fade . let them love one another as before , and let peace and plenty hold sway . � 
And his words spurred the eager 
Athene to swoop down from the heights of Olympus . / 
Meanwhile noble long-suffering 
Odysseus began to speak , 
now 
they had sated themselves with the pleasant meal , saying : �Someone 
should go and find out if 
they are closing in on us . � / 
At this command , one of Dolius� sons went out , and standing on the threshold he saw them nearby , and spoke winged words to 
Odysseus : �Quick , to arms , 
they are here already . � / 
They rose at his words and donned their armour . 
Odysseus and his comrades made four , and the sons of 
Dolius were six , and 
Laertes and 
Dolius wore their armour too , forced to fight despite their grey hairs . 
When 
they had all protected their bodies with gleaming bronze 
they opened the doors and ran out , 
Odysseus in the lead . / Bk  : 
Athene brings peace / 
Now 
Athene , Zeus� daughter , 
approached them , in the form and with the voice of mentor , and noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was overjoyed to see her , and spoke instantly to his brave son 
Telemachus : �Telemachus , 
now you have come to a place where the battle shows who is bravest do not disgrace your ancestors� house . 
We have always been first in strength and courage . � / �Dear father , � wise 
Telemachus replied , �in the mood I am in , you shall see me , as you say and wish , bring no disgrace to our lineage . � 
So he declared , and 
Laertes was pleased , and said : �What a day this is for me , dear gods ! I am all joy to see my son and grandson argue as to who is bravest . � / 
Then bright-eyed 
Athene 
approached him , saying : �Son of 
Arceisius , dearest of all my friends , pray to the bright-eyed maiden and 
Father 
Zeus , then raise high your long spear as you finish , and throw hard . � 
With this , while he prayed to the daughter of 
Zeus , she breathed great power into him . 
He raised his long spear high as he finished and threw , striking 
Eupeithes on the bronze-guarded helmet . 
The spear was not deflected , however , and travelled right through . 
Eupeithes fell with a thud and a clang of armour . 
Then 
Odysseus and his glorious son attacked the leading men , thrusting at them with their swords and double-edged spear-blades . 
They would have killed the lot , and ended their hopes of returning home , if 
Athene , Zeus� aegis-bearing daughter , had not shouted loudly , and restrained the combatants , crying : �Men of Ithaca , cease your fight , so that you may part without shedding each others� blood . � / 
They grew pale with fear at Athene�s call . 
The weapons flew from their hands in their terror , and fell to the ground , as 
they turned towards the town , eager to save their lives , eager to fly from the voice of the goddess . 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus gave a chilling cry , and gathering himself he swooped on them , like an eagle from the heights , just as 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , let fly a gleaming lightning bolt that fell at the feet of the bright-eyed daughter of that mighty 
Father . 
And bright-eyed 
Athene said to 
Odysseus : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes hold back your hand and stop this warring among you , lest 
Zeus the 
Thunderer grows angry . � / 
Odysseus 
obeyed Athene�s words , delighted at heart . 
Then 
Pallas 
Athene , Zeus� aegis-bearing daughter , in the form and with the voice of mentor , forged a solemn truce between the warring sides . /
