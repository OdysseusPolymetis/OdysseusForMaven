as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , Odysseus� steadfast son rose from his bed and dressed . 
He slung his sharp sword from his shoulder , bound fine sandals on his gleaming feet , and strode from his room like a god . 
Immediately he commanded the clear-voiced heralds to call the longhaired 
Achaeans to assemble . 
The heralds gave their cry and the 
Achaeans soon gathered . 
When the assembly had convened 
Telemachus walked there , bronze spear in hand , followed by two hunting dogs , and 
Athene endowed him with such grace that all marvelled at him as he arrived . 
The elders gave way , and he took his father�s seat . / noble 
Aegyptius was the first to speak , a man bent with age , but profoundly wise . 
He spoke because his dear son , 
Antiphus , a spearman , had sailed in the hollow ships with godlike 
Odysseus , to ilium , famous for its horses . 
The savage 
Cyclops killed 
Antiphus in his echoing cave , and made a meal of him . 
He had three more sons : Eurynomus had joined the 
Suitors , while two of them worked their father�s estate . 
Yet , sad and grieving , he could not forget the other : and on his account he spoke to the assembly : / �Listen to my words , men of Ithaca . 
We have not held a council or assembly since the day good 
Odysseus left in the hollow ships . 
Who calls us now ? 
Who of the young men or the old has that need ? 
Has he had news of the returning army and , first to hear , can give us a firm report ? or is there some other issue , a public matter , he wants to discuss ? a good and blessed man he appears to me . 
Whatever he wishes , may 
Zeus grant him some good . � / 
So he spoke , and Odysseus� steadfast son was delighted by his auspicious words : eager to speak he rose from his seat . 
Taking his stand in the middle of the assembly , he received the staff from Peisenor , the wise 
herald . 
Then he addressed old 
Aegyptius : / �Venerable man , he who called this meeting is here : I did so , since on me above all trouble falls . I have no news of the returning army , nor am first to hear , nor can give a firm report . Nor is it an issue of public concern I want to discuss . 
The need is personal : twin evils have befallen my house . Firstly I have lost my noble father , who was once your king , kindly as a father . 
And then , there is a far greater evil that robs me of my estate , and will utterly destroy my house . 
My 
mother has attracted 
Suitors , without wishing to do so , sons of the noblest men here . 
They shun the house of 
Icarius her father , where he himself might give her away as he wishes , to whoever meets his favour , and arrange her dowry . 
Instead 
they frequent our house day after day , slaughter our oxen , sheep and goats , feast themselves , and drink wildly of our glowing wine : most of our stores are already gone . 
There is no one like 
Odysseus here to prevent the ruin of our house . 
We are not strong enough : we could only prove how weak we are , inexperienced in a fight . 
Yet I would honestly defend myself if I had the power : since things are done that cannot be endured , and the destruction of my house reveals injustice . / 
You 
should be ashamed yourselves , feel shame before our neighbours too , and fear the gods� anger , lest 
they turn on you in fury at evil actions . by 
Olympian 
Zeus , and by that Themis who joins and dissolves the councils of men , prevent it , my friends , and let me nurse my bitter grief alone , unless you think my father , good 
Odysseus , was so hostile to the bronze-greaved 
Achaeans and did them evil , that you , hostile to me , repay it with evil , by encouraging these 
Suitors . I had rather you yourselves consumed my wealth , my herds . if it were you , there might some day be compensation : we could go up and down the island pressing our claim , asking for our goods till all was repaid . but the sorrows you trouble my heart with are past cure . � / 
Weeping with anger , he hurled the staff to the ground : and 
they were seized with compassion . Everyone was silent , and none of them had the desire to answer 
Telemachus with angry words , until the lone voice of 
Antinous replied : / �Telemachus , great orator and bold spirit , how you put us to shame , pinning the blame on us ! 
Yet it is not the 
Achaean 
Suitors who are at fault , but your own 
mother , cleverest of women . Three years , almost four , she has misled our 
Achaean hearts . 
She holds out hope to all , sends messages of promise to every man , but her mind is fixed on other things . 
She contrived this piece of cunning , too , in her mind : she set up a great web in her hall , and began weaving with long fine thread . 
She said to us : �My lords , my 
Suitors , though 
Odysseus is dead and you are eager for me to marry , have patience till I complete this work , I do not want it wasted , this shroud for noble 
Laertes , ready for when pitiless death�s cruel end overtakes him : since I fear some 
Achaean woman of this land would blame me , if he who won great wealth lay there without a shroud . � / 
So she said , and though proud we agreed . 
Then day after day she wove the great web , but at night , by torchlight , she unmade it . 
So for three years she cunningly kept the 
Achaeans from knowing , and so tricked them . but when the fourth year began , as the seasons rolled by , one of her women , knowing all , told us , and we caught her unravelling its fineness . 
Then she was forced , unwillingly , to complete it . / 
Here is the Suitors� answer , for you and the 
Achaeans to keep clearly in mind : order your 
mother to marry whomever her father dictates , or whoever pleases her , but send her away . as long as she continues to frustrate the young 
Achaeans � given her mental powers that 
Athene granted her above other women , her knowledge in skilful work , sound sense , and intelligence such as we never heard of women of old , 
Tyro , 
Alcmene , or 
Mycene , of the lovely crown , none of them equal to 
Penelope in clever schemes , though this one was wrongly devised � so long will men consume your goods and livelihood , as long in other words as she keeps to this plan the gods suggest . 
She is winning great fame for herself , but brings to you regret for your vanishing wealth . 
And we will not go to our own estates , or anywhere else , until she marries whichever of the 
Achaeans she chooses . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �Antinous , there is no way I would drive the 
mother that bore me , and reared me , from my house against her will , while my father perhaps still lives in some far land . 
It would be wrong for me to repay the bride price to 
Icarius , as I must if I choose to send my 
mother away . I would suffer at her father�s hands , and the gods would send other sufferings , since my 
mother would call to the avenging furies on leaving , and men would blame me . I will never command it . if you are angered about all this then leave the palace , and feast elsewhere , move from house to house , and eat your own provisions . if it seems preferable , more profitable to you , to waste one man�s estate without restitution , then do so , but I meanwhile will call on the eternal gods hoping that 
Zeus might grant a day of reckoning . 
Then you will be wasted in my halls , without restitution . � / 
So 
Telemachus spoke , and 
Far-Seeing 
Zeus sent out two eagles from a high mountain peak . 
They flew for a while with outspread wings , side by side in the currents of air , but when 
they were above the voice-filled assembly 
they swiftly slanted their wings , circling round , gazing down on the heads below , and death was in their gaze . 
Then 
they clawed at each other�s head and neck with their talons , and soared away eastward over the roofs of the town . 
The people saw them and wondered , and considered what this might foreshadow . 
Then the old hero 
Halitherses , Mastor�s son , spoke out , for he was the wisest man of his day in bird-lore and prophecy . 
With goodwill in his heart he addressed the assembly : / �Men of Ithaca , listen to me : and I say these words to the 
Suitors especially , since disaster approaches them . 
Odysseus will not be far from his friends much longer , and I believe even now he is near , sowing the seeds of dark death for all these men . 
Yes , and he will bring trouble to many another of us , who live in clear-skied Ithaca . let us think in advance how we might prevent all this , or let them prevent it of their own accord , easily their best option . I am not unskilled in prophecy , but have true knowledge . I say that all things for that man will be fulfilled , just as I told him when the 
Argives sailed for 
Troy , he among them , resourceful 
Odysseus . I declared that , suffering many troubles , losing all comrades , he would return in the twentieth year , unknown to all : and now it is coming to pass . � / 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , replied : �Go home , old man , and prophesy to your children , in case 
they suffer harm in days to come . I am better at prophecies than you . Many birds fly here and there in the sunlight , and not all are fateful . as for 
Odysseus he has died far off , as you 
should have died . 
Then you would have less to say about omens , and not be fuelling Telemachus� anger , in hopes of him making a gift to your house . 
Now I will prophesy to you , and this will happen . if you , with the wisdom of old-age , seduce a younger man to anger with your chatter , it will be all the worse for him , for one thing , and for another these men here will obstruct him , while we will impose a fine on you , old man , that it will break your heart to pay , that will fill you with bitter pain . 
Here , among you all , I offer 
Telemachus my advice . let him send his 
mother home to her father�s house , where 
they will ready a wedding feast , and a wealth of gifts , fitting for a well-beloved daughter . till then , I think , the 
Achaean youth will not end their constant wooing , since we fear no man , certainly not 
Telemachus despite his many words , nor do we listen to any prophecy of yours , old man . 
It will disappoint , and you will be the more hated . 
And his goods will be ruthlessly wasted , without restitution , so long as 
Penelope denies herself to the 
Achaeans in marriage . for our part , we remain , day after day , in rivalry for that excellence , and we will not seek other women whom we might wed . � / 
Telemachus answered : �Eurymachus , and all you noble 
Suitors , I will ask no longer , nor speak of it , since the gods and the 
Achaeans now know . 
Instead , give me a fast ship and twenty friends to further my travels here and there . I shall go to Sparta and sandy 
Pylos , to search for news of my long-lost father�s return , in hope some mortal man may know , or of a rumour perhaps sent by 
Zeus that often brings news to men . if I hear he is alive , and on his way , then troubled though I am I could suffer one more year . but if I hear that he is dead and gone , I will return to my own land , build a mound , with all the funeral rites , generous ones as is fitting , and give my 
mother away to a new husband . � / 
Having spoken he sat down again , and mentor , a friend of faultless 
Odysseus , rose to speak . on leaving , 
Odysseus had entrusted his whole house to him : 
they to obey the old man , he to keep all things safe . 
With goodwill in his heart he now addressed the assembly : / �Men of Ithaca , hear my words . 
From now on let the king who wields the sceptre never show goodwill by being kind and gentle , or take justice to heart : let him instead be unjust and harsh forever , since none of the people whose king he was remember divine 
Odysseus , though he was kind as a father to them . in truth , it is not so much that I condemn the acts of violence the proud 
Suitors contrive in their dark minds , since 
they risk their own lives if their rapaciousness wastes the house of a man 
they say will never return . 
Rather the rest of you stir my indignation , sitting there silently , speaking no word of rebuke to make them stop , even though 
they are few and you are many . � / 
Then 
Leocritus , Euenor�s son , replied : �Mentor , you troublemaker , your wits are wandering : what are these words about ordering them to stop ! / However many you are , it would be hard to justify fighting over a meal . 
And if 
Odysseus himself returned to Ithaca , ready to drive away the noble 
Suitors dining in his palace , then his wife would have no joy of it , however much she had longed for him , since he would come to a wretched end there and then , fighting while outnumbered . 
Your speech has missed its mark . but disperse now , all you people , return to your own homes . let mentor and 
Halitherses speed this fellow on his way , since 
they are his father�s friends from long ago , though I believe he will never make the journey , but sit here in Ithaca forever , listening to rumours . � / 
So speaking , he concluded the assembly , brief though it had been . 
The people dispersed to their homes , while the 
Suitors returned to divine Odysseus� palace . / but 
Telemachus walked to the shore , alone , and washing his hands in the grey salt water 
prayed to 
Athene : �You , divine 
One , who yesterday came to my home , and suggested I sail over the misty sea to search for news of my long-lost father�s return , hear me . 
The 
Achaeans obstruct me , the evil and insolent 
Suitors most of all . � / 
He 
prayed , and 
Athene approached him , in the form and with the voice of mentor : and she spoke to him winged words : �Telemachus , if your father�s fine spirit is found in you , you will be neither a fool nor a coward in the time to come , and this journey of yours will be no idle failure . but if you are not Odysseus� and Penelope�s son , then I have no hopes of you achieving your end . 
There are not many sons , indeed , who resemble their fathers : most are worse , and only a few are better . but since you will be neither a fool nor a coward in the time to come , nor are you wholly lacking in Odysseus� wisdom , there is every hope of you achieving your goal . 
So forget the Suitor�s plans and intentions , 
they are fools , neither sensible nor just , nor are 
they thinking of death and the dark fate that is truly near , and will one day strike them . Nor will the journey you set your heart on be delayed , since I a true friend of your father�s house will ready a swift ship and sail with you . Go home now , and join the crowd of 
Suitors : then assemble provisions : the wine in jars , the barley meal , that nourishes men�s marrows , in tough skins . Meanwhile I will gather a volunteer crew in town . 
And there are plenty of ships , old and new , in sea-faring Ithaca . I will choose one of the best for you , and we will prepare her swiftly , and launch her in open water . � / 
Athene , daughter of 
Zeus , spoke , and 
Telemachus did not linger when he had heard the goddess� voice , but with a troubled heart set off for home . 
There he found the palace full of insolent 
Suitors , some skinning goats and singeing hogs in the courtyard . 
Antinous , laughing , came and clasped his hand straight away , saying : �Telemachus , noble orator , high in courage , empty your heart of violent words and deeds . 
Rather , eat and drink as before , I urge you . a ship and a choice crew , all those things , the 
Achaeans will certainly provide , so you can sail swiftly to sacred 
Pylos , to search for news of your noble father . � / but wise 
Telemachus answered him : �Antinous there is no way I can savour the feast quietly , or enjoy myself with an easy mind , among this arrogant crowd . 
Is it not enough that you 
Suitors once robbed me of many fine possessions , when I was a child ? 
Now I am older , and have learned from other men�s words , now my powers grow , I will find a way to hasten your fates of dark death , whether by going to 
Pylos or staying here . but go I will , and the journey will be not wasted , even if I sail in another man�s ship , since I know it suits you better not to allow me ship or crew . � / 
He spoke , and easily freed himself from Antinous� hand , while the 
Suitors were busy feasting throughout the hall . 
Talking , 
they mocked and jeered him , and some insolent youth said : �Telemachus plans to murder us , for sure . 
Perhaps he will gather men from Sparta or sandy 
Pylos to help him in his deadly intent . or perhaps he will head for Ephyre�s fertile land , to bring back fatal drugs to drop in the wine bowl , and end us all . � / 
Again , another of the insolent youths , said : �Who knows ? 
He might vanish himself in his hollow ship , far from friends , wandering as 
Odysseus did . 
That would make more trouble for us , since we would have to divide his goods ourselves , give his 
mother the palace as hers , and his who marries her . � / 
These were their words , but 
Telemachus went down to his father�s storeroom , a wide tall chamber piled high with gold and bronze , with chests full of clothing , and jars of fragrant oil . 
There too in rows along the wall , waiting for 
Odysseus to return , if ever , after his many sufferings stood huge jars of sweet unmixed wine , of pure vintage . 
The double doors were tightly closed : and a clear-minded stewardess guarded it all , 
Eurycleia , daughter of 
Ops the son of Peisenor . 
When 
Telemachus had summoned her to the storeroom , he said : �Draw me wine in jars , nurse , sweet wine of the choicest , only bettered by that which you save in case divine 
Odysseus , that man of ill fortune , escapes from death and fate and returns from who knows where . 
Fill twelve jars and stopper them , and pour barley-meal into tightly sewn skins , twenty measures from the grinding mill . 
Keep it to yourself . Get all this together and I will come for it this evening , when my 
mother has gone to her bedchamber . I am going to Sparta and sandy 
Pylos , to seek for news , in case I may hear something of my loyal father�s return . � / At this , faithful 
Eurycleia gave a loud cry , and spoke winged words of lament to him : �Dear child , what thought has entered your mind ? 
Where are you off to , over the wide earth , you an only and a well-beloved son ? divine 
Odysseus has died far from his country , in a foreign land : and as soon as you are gone these men will plot evil towards you : you will be killed by cunning , and 
they will divide what is yours . 
Stay here , and rule your own : there is no call for you to go wandering , suffering sorrow on the barren waves . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered her : �Courage , nurse , for this the gods intend . but swear not to tell my 
mother of it , till eleven or twelve days hence , or till she misses me , and hears I have gone , so she does not spoil her beauty with weeping . � / At this , the old woman swore by all the gods to say nothing . 
When she had sworn her oath , she drew the wine in jars for him , and poured barley meal into tightly sewn skins , while 
Telemachus strode to the hall , and joined the crowd of 
Suitors . / 
Now the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had another idea . 
Disguised as 
Telemachus she went through the town telling the men she chose to gather by the swift ship that evening . 
The ship itself she asked of 
Noemon , the famed son of 
Phronius , and he promised it to her willingly . / At sunset , when the tracks were darkened , she drew the swift ship down to the sea , and stowed in her all the gear that large ships carry . 
Then she moored her at the harbour mouth , and the noble crew gathered round , and she encouraged each man . / 
Now , the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had another idea . 
She made her way to divine Odysseus� home , and poured sweet drowsiness over the 
Suitors , clouding their minds as 
they drank , striking the cups from their hands . Eyelids heavy with sleep , 
they did not linger , but rose and went to their beds in town . but bright-eyed 
Athene , disguised as mentor in voice and form , called 
Telemachus out of the noble palace , and spoke to him : / �Telemachus , your bronze-greaved friends will be waiting for you , at their oars . Come now , so we no longer delay our journey . � / 
With this , 
Pallas 
Athene quickly led the way , and he followed the goddess� footsteps . 
When 
they came down to the sea and the ship , 
they found their longhaired crew ashore , and royal 
Telemachus spoke to them : / �Friends , let us bring the stores , collected at the palace . 
My 
mother and her maids know nothing : there is only one I have told . � / 
So saying , he led the way , and 
they followed . 
They brought down and stowed everything in the large ship , as Odysseus� steadfast son commanded . 
Then 
Telemachus 
boarded the ship , 
Athene going before him . 
She took her seat at the stern , and he beside her , while the crew loosed the hawsers , and climbed on board , and took their place at the oars , along the benches . 
And bright-eyed 
Athene called up a strong and favourable westerly breeze that went singing over the wine-dark sea . 
And 
Telemachus shouted to his crew to lay hold of the tackle and , obeying , 
they raised the pine mast , set it in its hollow box and rigged the stays , and with plaited ox-hide ropes 
they hoisted the white sail . 
It bellied in the wind , and the dark wave hissed loud at the keel , as she gathered way over the water . 
When all was made fast in the swift black ship , 
they prepared brimming bowls of wine , and poured libations to the deathless gods , above all the bright-eyed daughter of 
Zeus . 
And all night long and into the dawn the ship ploughed her way . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , Odysseus� steadfast son rose from his bed and dressed . 
He slung his sharp sword from his shoulder , bound fine sandals on his gleaming feet , and strode from his room like a god . 
Immediately he commanded the clear-voiced heralds to call the longhaired 
Achaeans to assemble . 
The heralds gave their cry and the 
Achaeans soon gathered . 
When the assembly had convened 
Telemachus walked there , bronze spear in hand , followed by two hunting dogs , and 
Athene endowed him with such grace that all marvelled at him as he arrived .

So he spoke , and Odysseus� steadfast son was delighted by his auspicious words : eager to speak he rose from his seat .

Here , among you all , I offer 
Telemachus my advice . let him send his 
mother home to her father�s house , where 
they will ready a wedding feast , and a wealth of gifts , fitting for a well-beloved daughter . till then , I think , the 
Achaean youth will not end their constant wooing , since we fear no man , certainly not 
Telemachus despite his many words , nor do we listen to any prophecy of yours , old man . 
It will disappoint , and you will be the more hated . 
And his goods will be ruthlessly wasted , without restitution , so long as 
Penelope denies herself to the 
Achaeans in marriage . for our part , we remain , day after day , in rivalry for that excellence , and we will not seek other women whom we might wed . � / 
Telemachus answered : �Eurymachus , and all you noble 
Suitors , I will ask no longer , nor speak of it , since the gods and the 
Achaeans now know . 
Instead , give me a fast ship and twenty friends to further my travels here and there . I shall go to Sparta and sandy 
Pylos , to search for news of my long-lost father�s return , in hope some mortal man may know , or of a rumour perhaps sent by 
Zeus that often brings news to men . if I hear he is alive , and on his way , then troubled though I am I could suffer one more year . but if I hear that he is dead and gone , I will return to my own land , build a mound , with all the funeral rites , generous ones as is fitting , and give my 
mother away to a new husband . � / 
Having spoken he sat down again , and mentor , a friend of faultless 
Odysseus , rose to speak . on leaving , 
Odysseus had entrusted his whole house to him : 
they to obey the old man , he to keep all things safe . 
With goodwill in his heart he now addressed the assembly : / �Men of Ithaca , hear my words . 
From now on let the king who wields the sceptre never show goodwill by being kind and gentle , or take justice to heart : let him instead be unjust and harsh forever , since none of the people whose king he was remember divine 
Odysseus , though he was kind as a father to them . in truth , it is not so much that I condemn the acts of violence the proud 
Suitors contrive in their dark minds , since 
they risk their own lives if their rapaciousness wastes the house of a man 
they say will never return . 
Rather the rest of you stir my indignation , sitting there silently , speaking no word of rebuke to make them stop , even though 
they are few and you are many . � / 
Then 
Leocritus , Euenor�s son , replied : �Mentor , you troublemaker , your wits are wandering : what are these words about ordering them to stop ! / However many you are , it would be hard to justify fighting over a meal . 
And if 
Odysseus himself returned to Ithaca , ready to drive away the noble 
Suitors dining in his palace , then his wife would have no joy of it , however much she had longed for him , since he would come to a wretched end there and then , fighting while outnumbered . 
Your speech has missed its mark . but disperse now , all you people , return to your own homes . let mentor and 
Halitherses speed this fellow on his way , since 
they are his father�s friends from long ago , though I believe he will never make the journey , but sit here in Ithaca forever , listening to rumours . � / 
So speaking , he concluded the assembly , brief though it had been . 
The people dispersed to their homes , while the 
Suitors returned to divine Odysseus� palace . / but 
Telemachus walked to the shore , alone , and washing his hands in the grey salt water 
prayed to 
Athene : �You , divine 
One , who yesterday came to my home , and suggested I sail over the misty sea to search for news of my long-lost father�s return , hear me . 
The 
Achaeans obstruct me , the evil and insolent 
Suitors most of all . � / 
He 
prayed , and 
Athene approached him , in the form and with the voice of mentor : and she spoke to him winged words : �Telemachus , if your father�s fine spirit is found in you , you will be neither a fool nor a coward in the time to come , and this journey of yours will be no idle failure . but if you are not Odysseus� and Penelope�s son , then I have no hopes of you achieving your end . 
There are not many sons , indeed , who resemble their fathers : most are worse , and only a few are better . but since you will be neither a fool nor a coward in the time to come , nor are you wholly lacking in Odysseus� wisdom , there is every hope of you achieving your goal . 
So forget the Suitor�s plans and intentions , 
they are fools , neither sensible nor just , nor are 
they thinking of death and the dark fate that is truly near , and will one day strike them . Nor will the journey you set your heart on be delayed , since I a true friend of your father�s house will ready a swift ship and sail with you . Go home now , and join the crowd of 
Suitors : then assemble provisions : the wine in jars , the barley meal , that nourishes men�s marrows , in tough skins . Meanwhile I will gather a volunteer crew in town . 
And there are plenty of ships , old and new , in sea-faring Ithaca . I will choose one of the best for you , and we will prepare her swiftly , and launch her in open water . � / 
Athene , daughter of 
Zeus , spoke , and 
Telemachus did not linger when he had heard the goddess� voice , but with a troubled heart set off for home . 
There he found the palace full of insolent 
Suitors , some skinning goats and singeing hogs in the courtyard . 
Antinous , laughing , came and clasped his hand straight away , saying : �Telemachus , noble orator , high in courage , empty your heart of violent words and deeds . 
Rather , eat and drink as before , I urge you . a ship and a choice crew , all those things , the 
Achaeans will certainly provide , so you can sail swiftly to sacred 
Pylos , to search for news of your noble father . � / but wise 
Telemachus answered him : �Antinous there is no way I can savour the feast quietly , or enjoy myself with an easy mind , among this arrogant crowd . 
Is it not enough that you 
Suitors once robbed me of many fine possessions , when I was a child ? 
Now I am older , and have learned from other men�s words , now my powers grow , I will find a way to hasten your fates of dark death , whether by going to 
Pylos or staying here . but go I will , and the journey will be not wasted , even if I sail in another man�s ship , since I know it suits you better not to allow me ship or crew . � / 
He spoke , and easily freed himself from Antinous� hand , while the 
Suitors were busy feasting throughout the hall . 
Talking , 
they mocked and jeered him , and some insolent youth said : �Telemachus plans to murder us , for sure . 
Perhaps he will gather men from Sparta or sandy 
Pylos to help him in his deadly intent . or perhaps he will head for Ephyre�s fertile land , to bring back fatal drugs to drop in the wine bowl , and end us all . � / 
Again , another of the insolent youths , said : �Who knows ? 
He might vanish himself in his hollow ship , far from friends , wandering as 
Odysseus did . 
That would make more trouble for us , since we would have to divide his goods ourselves , give his 
mother the palace as hers , and his who marries her . � / 
These were their words , but 
Telemachus went down to his father�s storeroom , a wide tall chamber piled high with gold and bronze , with chests full of clothing , and jars of fragrant oil . 
There too in rows along the wall , waiting for 
Odysseus to return , if ever , after his many sufferings stood huge jars of sweet unmixed wine , of pure vintage . 
The double doors were tightly closed : and a clear-minded stewardess guarded it all , 
Eurycleia , daughter of 
Ops the son of Peisenor . 
When 
Telemachus had summoned her to the storeroom , he said : �Draw me wine in jars , nurse , sweet wine of the choicest , only bettered by that which you save in case divine 
Odysseus , that man of ill fortune , escapes from death and fate and returns from who knows where . 
Fill twelve jars and stopper them , and pour barley-meal into tightly sewn skins , twenty measures from the grinding mill . 
Keep it to yourself . Get all this together and I will come for it this evening , when my 
mother has gone to her bedchamber . I am going to Sparta and sandy 
Pylos , to seek for news , in case I may hear something of my loyal father�s return . � / At this , faithful 
Eurycleia gave a loud cry , and spoke winged words of lament to him : �Dear child , what thought has entered your mind ? 
Where are you off to , over the wide earth , you an only and a well-beloved son ? divine 
Odysseus has died far from his country , in a foreign land : and as soon as you are gone these men will plot evil towards you : you will be killed by cunning , and 
they will divide what is yours . 
Stay here , and rule your own : there is no call for you to go wandering , suffering sorrow on the barren waves . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered her : �Courage , nurse , for this the gods intend . but swear not to tell my 
mother of it , till eleven or twelve days hence , or till she misses me , and hears I have gone , so she does not spoil her beauty with weeping . � / At this , the old woman swore by all the gods to say nothing . 
When she had sworn her oath , she drew the wine in jars for him , and poured barley meal into tightly sewn skins , while 
Telemachus strode to the hall , and joined the crowd of 
Suitors . / 
Now the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had another idea . 
Disguised as 
Telemachus she went through the town telling the men she chose to gather by the swift ship that evening . 
The ship itself she asked of 
Noemon , the famed son of 
Phronius , and he promised it to her willingly . / At sunset , when the tracks were darkened , she drew the swift ship down to the sea , and stowed in her all the gear that large ships carry . 
Then she moored her at the harbour mouth , and the noble crew gathered round , and she encouraged each man . / 
Now , the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had another idea . 
She made her way to divine Odysseus� home , and poured sweet drowsiness over the 
Suitors , clouding their minds as 
they drank , striking the cups from their hands . Eyelids heavy with sleep , 
they did not linger , but rose and went to their beds in town . but bright-eyed 
Athene , disguised as mentor in voice and form , called 
Telemachus out of the noble palace , and spoke to him : / �Telemachus , your bronze-greaved friends will be waiting for you , at their oars . Come now , so we no longer delay our journey . � / 
With this , 
Pallas 
Athene quickly led the way , and he followed the goddess� footsteps . 
When 
they came down to the sea and the ship , 
they found their longhaired crew ashore , and royal 
Telemachus spoke to them : / �Friends , let us bring the stores , collected at the palace . 
My 
mother and her maids know nothing : there is only one I have told . � / 
So saying , he led the way , and 
they followed . 
They brought down and stowed everything in the large ship , as Odysseus� steadfast son commanded . 
Then 
Telemachus 
boarded the ship , 
Athene going before him . 
She took her seat at the stern , and he beside her , while the crew loosed the hawsers , and climbed on board , and took their place at the oars , along the benches . 
And bright-eyed 
Athene called up a strong and favourable westerly breeze that went singing over the wine-dark sea . 
And 
Telemachus shouted to his crew to lay hold of the tackle and , obeying , 
they raised the pine mast , set it in its hollow box and rigged the stays , and with plaited ox-hide ropes 
they hoisted the white sail . 
It bellied in the wind , and the dark wave hissed loud at the keel , as she gathered way over the water . 
When all was made fast in the swift black ship , 
they prepared brimming bowls of wine , and poured libations to the deathless gods , above all the bright-eyed daughter of 
Zeus . 
And all night long and into the dawn the ship ploughed her way . /
