noble 
Odysseus lay down to sleep in the hallway of the house . 
He spread an un-tanned ox-hide on the floor and covered it with a pile of fleeces , from the sheep the 
Achaeans killed each day . 
When he had settled down , Eurynome threw a cloak over him . 
There the sleepless 
Odysseus lay , planning trouble for the 
Suitors . out from the hall poured the women who slept with the 
Suitors , giggling and joking among themselves . His anger was roused , and he pondered in his mind , whether he should chase them down and kill them , or leave them to sleep with the arrogant 
Suitors one last time . 
He growled inside , like a bitch guarding her vulnerable pups , ready to fight on seeing a stranger . 
He growled inside with anger at their evil ways , but striking his chest he restrained his heart , saying : �Patience , my heart . 
You endured worse than this when the 
Cyclops , with his huge strength , ate my loyal friends : yet you held firm until your cunning released you from that cave where you faced death . � / 
Such were his words of self-rebuke , and his heart obediently steeled itself to patience , but he still lay tossing this way and that . 
Like a paunch filled with fat and blood turning in front of a blazing fire , twisted about by the man who roasts it , eager to see it done , so 
Odysseus turned from side to side , considering how to tackle the shameless 
Suitors , one man against many . 
Then it was that 
Athene descended from heaven , and approached him in the form of a mortal woman . She stood by his head and spoke to him , saying : �Why are you awake still , most ill-fated of men ? 
This is your house , and here is your wife and child , a son such as any man might pray to have . � / �Goddess , � resourceful 
Odysseus answered , �all you say is true indeed , but my mind is considering how to tackle the shameless 
Suitors on my own , if they are crowded together as usual in the palace . 
And there�s a second more difficult issue I�m thinking of : even if I kill them , with Zeus� help and yours , how can I escape vengeance ? I ask you to think of that . � / Bright-eyed 
Athene replied : �You are never satisfied . 
Many a man puts his faith in some mere mortal , a weaker ally than me , without my wisdom . I am a goddess , and never cease to protect you in all your labours . I say clearly , if fifty ranks of mere mortals surround us , ready to kill us in battle , you would still drive off their fat sheep and cattle . 
Now , go to sleep . 
Staying awake all night will add to your weariness , just when you are about to shake off your troubles . � / 
With this the lovely goddess closed his eyes in sleep then she herself returned to Olympus . / as sleep gripped him , easing his heart�s care , sleep that slackens men�s limbs , his loyal wife woke , and sitting on her soft bed she wept . 
Then when she had finished crying , her first thought was to pray to 
Artemis : �Artemis , great 
Goddess , daughter of 
Zeus , if you would only pierce my breast with an arrow , and take my life this very hour : or let the storm wind snatch me up , carry me over the darkened ways , and abandon me at the mouth of Ocean�s backflow , as the winds once carried off Pandareus� daughters . 
The gods had killed their parents , and left them orphans in the palace , but lovely 
Aphrodite fed them cheese , sweet honey , and mellow wine , while 
Hera gave them greater beauty and wisdom than other girls , you , chaste 
Artemis made them tall , and 
Athene taught them how to create beautiful things . but on the very day when lovely 
Aphrodite went to high Olympus to ask 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , who knows the fate of all things mortal , happy or unhappy , to grant the girls joyful marriages , the harpies snatched them away , and handed them over to the dread furies . if only the dwellers on Olympus would hide me from sight like that , or you , 
Artemis of the lovely tresses , would strike me dead , so I might descend beneath the hateful earth with 
Odysseus in my thoughts , rather than gladdening a lesser man�s heart . Painful things can be endured if one sleeps at night , even if by day one weeps with an aching heart � sleep makes us forget all things , joy and pain , when it weighs on our eyelids � but a god makes my dreams painful too . 
This very night it seemed 
Odysseus lay by my side once more , looking as he did when he left with his army , and my heart leapt thinking it was the truth and no dream . � / as she spoke , golden-throned 
Dawn appeared , and noble 
Odysseus heard her voice amidst the tears , and thinking of her it seemed to him as though she stood by his head and recognised him . 
He swept up the cloak and fleeces from his bed , and dropped them on a chair in the hall , carrying the ox-hide outside and throwing it down . 
Then he lifted his hands in prayer to 
Zeus : �Father 
Zeus , if indeed it is with goodwill that you gods have brought me home over land and sea , after persecuting me so harshly , let someone waking in the palace speak a word of good omen for me , and 
Zeus , show me a sign here as well . � / 
So he prayed , and 
Zeus the 
All-Knowing heard him . At once the god thundered from shining Olympus out of a cloudless sky , and noble 
Odysseus rejoiced . 
Then a woman grinding corn at the mill in a building nearby , that housed all the mills belonging to the shepherd of the people , spoke a word of omen from within . Twelve women laboured at these mills , grinding meal that nourishes men from wheat and barley . 
The other women were still asleep , having ground their quota , but she , not having their strength had not yet finished . 
Now she stopped her mill , and uttered words of good omen for her master : �Father 
Zeus , lord of gods and men , how you thunder from the starry sky , and never a cloud in sight . 
It must be an omen you send someone . Make even my words come true . 
Today let the 
Suitors delight in feasting for the very last time in 
Odysseus� palace . let those who have bowed my limbs in hard labour grinding barley , now eat their last meal . � / Those were her words , and noble Odysseus was delighted with the omen and that of Zeus� thunder , as he planned his vengeance on the sinners . / by now the rest of the maids in Odysseus� glorious palace were about , kindling the dormant fire on the hearth , and 
Telemachus rose from his bed , looking like a god , and put on his clothes . 
He slung his sharp sword from one shoulder , fastened a fine pair of sandals on his shining feet , picked up his tough , sharp bronze-tipped spear , took up his stand at the threshold , and spoke to 
Eurycleia . / �Nurse , my dear , have you taken proper care with the stranger�s food and bed , or has he had to make the best of it ? 
That is the sort of treatment my mother allows , despite her wisdom : it is sad how she will honour a worse man , and send a better away disregarded . � / �Child , � wise 
Eurycleia replied , �you should not blame one who is blameless . 
The stranger sat drinking wine as long as he wished , but when she asked about food , he said he wasn�t hungry . 
When he felt it was time to sleep , she told the maids to make up a bed , but he , like the sorry unfortunate he is , chose not to sleep on a bed with blankets , but lay down on an un-tanned ox-hide with sheepskins over him , in the hallway , and we covered him with a cloak . � / At this , 
Telemachus left the hall , spear in hand , followed by a pair of hounds , and made his way to the gathering place to join the crowd of 
Achaean nobles . Meanwhile good 
Eurycleia , the daughter of 
Ops , Peisenor�s son , called her orders to the maids : �Some of you sweep the hall thoroughly , and sprinkle the floors , and spread the purple covers over those good chairs . 
Others , sponge the tables down , rinse the mixing bowls , and the fine two-handled cups . 
The rest of you go down to the well for water : bring some back here quickly . 
The 
Suitors will soon be back in the palace , earlier than usual , since it�s a feast day for us all . � / 
The girls paid attention and obeyed her orders . 
Twenty of them went off to the well of clear black water , while the others exercised their skill in the household tasks . / 
The Achaeans� menservants then appeared , and while they were still splitting logs for firewood , neatly and skilfully , the girls returned from the well , followed by the swineherd 
driving three hogs , the pick of the herd . 
He left them to feed in the magnificent courtyard , while he spoke warmly to 
Odysseus : �My friend , do these 
Achaeans treat you any better , here , or do they still behave badly towards you ? � / �Ah , 
Eumaeus , � resourceful 
Odysseus replied , �if only the gods some day would take revenge on these insolent and shameless men for the outrage they commit , acting out their evil games in another man�s house . � / as they spoke 
Melanthius the goatherd arrived , bringing in the best she-goats of the herd for the Suitors� feast , and two herdsmen followed on behind . 
They tethered the goats under the echoing portico , and 
Melanthius began taunting 
Odysseus again . / �Are you still plaguing us , 
Stranger , begging in the hall ? Isn�t it time you were off and away ? Whatever happens , I suspect we won�t part till we�ve had each others� fists in our faces , since you beg in so vile a manner . 
There are other places to eat among the 
Achaeans , for sure . � 
Resourceful 
Odysseus made no reply to this , merely shaking his head in silence , plotting vengeance in his heart . / 
Then there came a third arrival , 
Philoetius , the master-cowherd , 
driving a barren heifer and plump she-goats for the 
Suitors . 
They had been brought from the mainland , by the ferrymen who give passage to anyone who appears . 
He carefully tethered the animals under the echoing portico , then approached the swineherd and questioned him : �Who is this new arrival , this stranger , 
Eumaeus ? 
What ancestry does he claim ? 
Where are his people and his country ? an unlucky wretch ! 
He carries himself like a king , but the gods bring trouble on wanderers , kings or no , when they spin the threads of sorrow for them . � / 
Saying this , he went over to 
Odysseus and stretched out his hand in greeting , speaking winged words as he did so : �Well met , old man ! You�re in the grip of misery now , but good luck to you in future . 
Father 
Zeus , you are the most pitiless of gods , without compassion for men who owe their existence to you , bringing us wretchedness and fierce suffering . 
When I saw you , 
Stranger , I broke into a sweat , and my eyes filled with tears , thinking of 
Odysseus , who must be dressed in rags like yours , a wanderer too among men , if he still lives at all and sees the sunlight . if he�s already dead , and in Hades� house , then alas for peerless 
Odysseus who put me in charge of his cattle in 
Cephallenian country , when I was just a lad . 
And now the herd�s increased past counting . 
Never have broad-browed cattle swelled their numbers more readily for any mortal man . but now strangers order me to bring them for their feast , indifferent to the son of the house , fearless of the gods� anger , ready to parcel out our long-absent master�s possessions . I keep turning the thing over and over in my mind : it would seem wrong for me to take my own cattle and go abroad , among an alien people , yet it�s worse still to stay here and suffer , in charge of cattle others appropriate . It�s so bad here , I�d have been off ages ago , off to some other powerful prince , if it wasn�t for thinking still about that unfortunate man , wondering if he might still return from who knows where , and drive the 
Suitors from his house . � / �Cowherd , � resourceful 
Odysseus answered , �since you seem a good and intelligent soul , and I see your heart is full of understanding , I will speak plainly , and swear a binding oath I speak true . by 
Zeus above all , and by this hospitable table , and by faultless 
Odysseus� hearth I have reached , I swear Odysseus will return while you are here , and if you choose to do so , you will see clearly with your own eyes the slaughter of these 
Suitors who play the master here . � / �Ah , 
Stranger , � the master herdsman replied , �if only 
Zeus , the son of 
Cronos , would make your words come true ! 
Then you would see the strength I can still show in my hands . � 
And likewise 
Eumaeus added a prayer to all the gods for wise Odysseus� safe return . / 
So they talked . 
Now , as the assembled 
Suitors were once more plotting 
Telemachus� death , a bird appeared on their left , an eagle high in the air grasping a dove numb with fear . Amphinomus rose and addressed them : �Friends , this plan of ours to kill Telemachus isn�t workable . 
We should think for now about feasting instead . � 
They all agreed , and entering godlike Odysseus� palace they threw their cloaks over stools and chairs , and began slaughtering well-fed sheep , fat goats , and swine , and a heifer from the herd . 
They roasted and served the innards , and mixed wine bowls , and the swineherd handed round the cups . 
Philoetius , the master cowherd , served bread in a well-crafted basket , while 
Melanthius poured the wine . 
Then they helped themselves to the good food in front of them . / but 
Telemachus , cleverly , placed a shabby stool and a small table for 
Odysseus near the stone threshold inside the great hall . 
He served him a portion of the innards , and poured him some wine in a gold cup , saying : �Sit here , among the noble 
Suitors , and drink your wine , and I will protect you from any insults and violence . 
This is no common house , but Odysseus� palace , and destined to be my inheritance . 
And you 
Suitors can keep words of abuse and blows from your thoughts , and make sure there�s no sign of a quarrel or a brawl . � / 
They all bit their lips at this , amazed at Telemachus� boldness , and 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , called out : �Achaeans , let us do as 
Telemachus says , hard though it is to take when he threatens us so aggressively . 
Zeus son of 
Cronus forbade it , or we would have silenced him before now , loud as he is . � but 
Telemachus paid no attention to what 
Antinous said . / Heralds were leading a hecatomb of sacrificial victims through the town , as the long-haired 
Achaean townsfolk gathered in 
Apollo the Archer�s shadowy grove , while in the palace the roast meat drawn from the spit was served , and fuelled a noble feast . 
The serving men gave 
Odysseus the same-sized portion as those the 
Suitors themselves received , so 
Telemachus decreed , godlike Odysseus� own son . but 
Athene had no intention of preventing the arrogant 
Suitors from hurling bitter insults , so that 
Odysseus , Laertes� son , might experience deeper heart-ache . / 
One of the 
Suitors , named 
Ctesippus , who came from 
Same , a man who cared nothing for the law , was courting the wife of the long-absent 
Odysseus , trusting in the power of his own vast wealth . 
He it was who now addressed the insolent 
Suitors . �Pay attention to me , you noble 
Suitors , and hear what I have to say . 
The 
Stranger has received a fair share , as is fitting , since it is right not to fail in hospitality to Telemachus� house-guests , whoever they may be . 
Come , I too will give him a guest-gift , and he can give it as a present to a bath-girl or one of godlike Odysseus� other slaves . � / 
With this , he laid his strong hand on an ox�s hoof in the basket , and hurled it at 
Odysseus , who avoided it with a swift movement of his head , stifling a grim sardonic smile as the hoof struck the wall with a thud . 
Telemachus turned on 
Ctesippus , saying : �Lucky for you indeed 
Ctesippus that the stranger dodged your missile and you failed to hit him . if you had I would have run you through with my sharp spear , and your father would have been planning a funeral , not a wedding feast . I warn you I�ll have no displays of violence in my house , I am aware of everything now , the good and the bad , and am no longer a child . I am forced nonetheless to view these things , the slaughtered sheep , the wine and bread consumed , because it is hard for one man to set himself against a crowd . hostile you may be , but do me no harm , or if you are so keen to murder me with your bronze blade , even that would be better , dying would be preferable than to look on endlessly at disgraceful actions , guests maltreated and maids handled shamefully in this great palace . � / 
They all fell silent at his words , until at last 
Agelaus , Damastor�s son , spoke out . �My friends , no man should show anger or reply with carping words to what has been fairly said . No more violence against the stranger , or any servant of godlike Odysseus� house . 
And I would say this , gently , to 
Telemachus and his mother , hoping it might seem good to them . 
So long as you had hope in your hearts that wise 
Odysseus would return home , no one could blame you for waiting , and discouraging 
Suitors . 
It would have proved the right thing if 
Odysseus had indeed come home . but now it is clear he won�t be back , sit by your mother , 
Telemachus , and explain that she should marry the best of us , the one who offers her most , and you can enjoy your inheritance from your father , in peace , the food and wine , while she tends another man�s house . � / �Not so , 
Agelaus , � subtle 
Telemachus replied , �I swear by 
Zeus and my father�s sufferings , he being dead or wandering , far from Ithaca , that I pose no obstacle to my mother�s marrying . I rather urge her to wed whoever she wishes , and with countless gifts from me . but I�d be ashamed to drive her from the palace against her will and at my command . 
May the gods always prevent such actions . � / 
Pallas 
Athene now provoked the 
Suitors to uncontrollable laughter at Telemachus� words , and addled their wits . 
They laughed with strained expressions , and as blood spattered their food their eyes filled with tears , and they seemed to themselves to be grieving . 
Then it was that godlike Theoclymenus called out : �Oh , you luckless men , what evil is this you suffer ? 
From head to toe you are shrouded in darkness . 
The sound of weeping rises and your cheeks are bathed in tears , while the walls and panelling are soaked with blood . 
And the porch and the court are filled with ghosts , ghosts hurrying to Erebus by night : the sun has vanished from the sky , and a foul mist blankets all . � / 
The whole crowd roared with delight at his words , and 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , spoke out : �Our new arrival from overseas is mad . quick boys , pack him off to the gathering place outside , since he finds it so dark in here . � / but godlike Theoclymenus answered : �I need no helpers of yours to show me the way , 
Eurymachus . I have ears and eyes and feet enough , and a sound head on my shoulders . 
They will guide me past the doors , since I foresee evil coming to you , that none of you 
Suitors can evade or escape , not one of you who display violence , and plan your mindless wickedness in godlike Odysseus� house . � 
With this he left the great palace , and sought out Peiraeus who gave him a fine welcome . / 
The 
Suitors meanwhile , egging each other on , tried to provoke 
Telemachus by mocking his guests . 
Such were the proud youths� comments : �No one is more unlucky with guests than you , 
Telemachus , seeing you are host to such a lousy beggar as this , always after the bread and wine , and without a job in peace or war , an encumbrance on the earth . 
And now this other leaps up to prophesy . You�d be better to take my advice , and clap these strangers aboard an oared ship heading for 
Sicily , and make a worthwhile profit from them . � / 
Telemachus paid no attention to the Suitor�s gibes , but kept his silence and an eye on his father , waiting for the moment when 
Odysseus would attack those shameless men . / 
Wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , seated opposite in her lovely chair , was obliged to listen to everything that was said . 
The 
Suitors had slaughtered cattle in large numbers , and prepared their meal amid gales of laughter , a fine banquet to ease the heart . but no dinner could be less appetising than the one a goddess and a mighty hero would soon set before them . 
Yet it was the 
Suitors who had begun it all , with their unacceptable actions . / noble 
Odysseus lay down to sleep in the hallway of the house . 
He spread an un-tanned ox-hide on the floor and covered it with a pile of fleeces , from the sheep the 
Achaeans killed each day . 
When he had settled down , Eurynome threw a cloak over him .

Zeus above all , and by this hospitable table , and by faultless 
Odysseus� hearth I have reached , I swear Odysseus will return while you are here , and if you choose to do so , you will see clearly with your own eyes the slaughter of these 
Suitors who play the master here . � / �Ah , 
Stranger , � the master herdsman replied , �if only 
Zeus , the son of 
Cronos , would make your words come true ! 
Then you would see the strength I can still show in my hands . � 
And likewise 
Eumaeus added a prayer to all the gods for wise Odysseus� safe return . / 
So they talked . 
Now , as the assembled 
Suitors were once more plotting 
Telemachus� death , a bird appeared on their left , an eagle high in the air grasping a dove numb with fear . Amphinomus rose and addressed them : �Friends , this plan of ours to kill Telemachus isn�t workable . 
We should think for now about feasting instead . � 
They all agreed , and entering godlike Odysseus� palace they threw their cloaks over stools and chairs , and began slaughtering well-fed sheep , fat goats , and swine , and a heifer from the herd . 
They roasted and served the innards , and mixed wine bowls , and the swineherd handed round the cups . 
Philoetius , the master cowherd , served bread in a well-crafted basket , while 
Melanthius poured the wine . 
Then they helped themselves to the good food in front of them . / but 
Telemachus , cleverly , placed a shabby stool and a small table for 
Odysseus near the stone threshold inside the great hall . 
He served him a portion of the innards , and poured him some wine in a gold cup , saying : �Sit here , among the noble 
Suitors , and drink your wine , and I will protect you from any insults and violence . 
This is no common house , but Odysseus� palace , and destined to be my inheritance . 
And you 
Suitors can keep words of abuse and blows from your thoughts , and make sure there�s no sign of a quarrel or a brawl . � / 
They all bit their lips at this , amazed at Telemachus� boldness , and 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , called out : �Achaeans , let us do as 
Telemachus says , hard though it is to take when he threatens us so aggressively . 
Zeus son of 
Cronus forbade it , or we would have silenced him before now , loud as he is . � but 
Telemachus paid no attention to what 
Antinous said . / Heralds were leading a hecatomb of sacrificial victims through the town , as the long-haired 
Achaean townsfolk gathered in 
Apollo the Archer�s shadowy grove , while in the palace the roast meat drawn from the spit was served , and fuelled a noble feast . 
The serving men gave 
Odysseus the same-sized portion as those the 
Suitors themselves received , so 
Telemachus decreed , godlike Odysseus� own son . but 
Athene had no intention of preventing the arrogant 
Suitors from hurling bitter insults , so that 
Odysseus , Laertes� son , might experience deeper heart-ache . / 
One of the 
Suitors , named 
Ctesippus , who came from 
Same , a man who cared nothing for the law , was courting the wife of the long-absent 
Odysseus , trusting in the power of his own vast wealth . 
He it was who now addressed the insolent 
Suitors . �Pay attention to me , you noble 
Suitors , and hear what I have to say . 
The 
Stranger has received a fair share , as is fitting , since it is right not to fail in hospitality to Telemachus� house-guests , whoever they may be . 
Come , I too will give him a guest-gift , and he can give it as a present to a bath-girl or one of godlike Odysseus� other slaves . � / 
With this , he laid his strong hand on an ox�s hoof in the basket , and hurled it at 
Odysseus , who avoided it with a swift movement of his head , stifling a grim sardonic smile as the hoof struck the wall with a thud . 
Telemachus turned on 
Ctesippus , saying : �Lucky for you indeed 
Ctesippus that the stranger dodged your missile and you failed to hit him . if you had I would have run you through with my sharp spear , and your father would have been planning a funeral , not a wedding feast . I warn you I�ll have no displays of violence in my house , I am aware of everything now , the good and the bad , and am no longer a child . I am forced nonetheless to view these things , the slaughtered sheep , the wine and bread consumed , because it is hard for one man to set himself against a crowd . hostile you may be , but do me no harm , or if you are so keen to murder me with your bronze blade , even that would be better , dying would be preferable than to look on endlessly at disgraceful actions , guests maltreated and maids handled shamefully in this great palace . � / 
They all fell silent at his words , until at last 
Agelaus , Damastor�s son , spoke out . �My friends , no man should show anger or reply with carping words to what has been fairly said . No more violence against the stranger , or any servant of godlike Odysseus� house . 
And I would say this , gently , to 
Telemachus and his mother , hoping it might seem good to them . 
So long as you had hope in your hearts that wise 
Odysseus would return home , no one could blame you for waiting , and discouraging 
Suitors . 
It would have proved the right thing if 
Odysseus had indeed come home . but now it is clear he won�t be back , sit by your mother , 
Telemachus , and explain that she should marry the best of us , the one who offers her most , and you can enjoy your inheritance from your father , in peace , the food and wine , while she tends another man�s house . � / �Not so , 
Agelaus , � subtle 
Telemachus replied , �I swear by 
Zeus and my father�s sufferings , he being dead or wandering , far from Ithaca , that I pose no obstacle to my mother�s marrying . I rather urge her to wed whoever she wishes , and with countless gifts from me . but I�d be ashamed to drive her from the palace against her will and at my command . 
May the gods always prevent such actions . � / 
Pallas 
Athene now provoked the 
Suitors to uncontrollable laughter at Telemachus� words , and addled their wits . 
They laughed with strained expressions , and as blood spattered their food their eyes filled with tears , and they seemed to themselves to be grieving . 
Then it was that godlike Theoclymenus called out : �Oh , you luckless men , what evil is this you suffer ? 
From head to toe you are shrouded in darkness . 
The sound of weeping rises and your cheeks are bathed in tears , while the walls and panelling are soaked with blood . 
And the porch and the court are filled with ghosts , ghosts hurrying to Erebus by night : the sun has vanished from the sky , and a foul mist blankets all . � / 
The whole crowd roared with delight at his words , and 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , spoke out : �Our new arrival from overseas is mad . quick boys , pack him off to the gathering place outside , since he finds it so dark in here . � / but godlike Theoclymenus answered : �I need no helpers of yours to show me the way , 
Eurymachus . I have ears and eyes and feet enough , and a sound head on my shoulders . 
They will guide me past the doors , since I foresee evil coming to you , that none of you 
Suitors can evade or escape , not one of you who display violence , and plan your mindless wickedness in godlike Odysseus� house . � 
With this he left the great palace , and sought out Peiraeus who gave him a fine welcome . / 
The 
Suitors meanwhile , egging each other on , tried to provoke 
Telemachus by mocking his guests . 
Such were the proud youths� comments : �No one is more unlucky with guests than you , 
Telemachus , seeing you are host to such a lousy beggar as this , always after the bread and wine , and without a job in peace or war , an encumbrance on the earth . 
And now this other leaps up to prophesy . You�d be better to take my advice , and clap these strangers aboard an oared ship heading for 
Sicily , and make a worthwhile profit from them . � / 
Telemachus paid no attention to the Suitor�s gibes , but kept his silence and an eye on his father , waiting for the moment when 
Odysseus would attack those shameless men . / 
Wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , seated opposite in her lovely chair , was obliged to listen to everything that was said . 
The 
Suitors had slaughtered cattle in large numbers , and prepared their meal amid gales of laughter , a fine banquet to ease the heart . but no dinner could be less appetising than the one a goddess and a mighty hero would soon set before them . 
Yet it was the 
Suitors who had begun it all , with their unacceptable actions . /
