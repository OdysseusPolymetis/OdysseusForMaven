�Leaving the river of 
Ocean , and crossing the wide sea waves , we came again to the Isle of 
Aeaea , where 
Eos the 
Dawn has her house and dancing 
Floor : to the place where the sun rises . 
There we beached our ship on the sand and leapt to the shore , and there we slept until bright day . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , I sent my men to Circe�s house to recover Elpenor�s corpse . 
Then swiftly cutting logs of wood we performed the funeral rites , grieving and in tears , on the furthest point of the headland . 
When the body had burnt , and with it the dead man�s armour , we heaped a mound , and raised a stone on top , and at the summit we fixed his well-shaped oar . / 
Circe was well aware of our return from Hades� house , and while we were busy with our tasks she adorned herself and hastened to us , her handmaids bringing plenty of bread and meat , and glowing red wine . 
She stood there in the centre , and addressed us : �Resolute men , to have gone down living to Hades� house , you who will meet death twice , while others die only once . 
Eat then and drink here today , but when 
Dawn comes set sail , and I will show the way and explain the course so you can avoid pain and suffering on sea or land for lack of a decent plan . � / To this our proud hearts yielded , and all day long till the sun set we feasted on ample meat and wine . 
When the sun went down and darkness fell , my men lay down to sleep by the ships� cables , but 
Circe took my hand and led me apart from my friends , and made me sit down and tell the tale , as she lay there beside me . I related it all in proper sequence . � / �Then royal 
Circe said : �So , it all came to pass . 
Well listen now to what I tell you , and let some god remind you of it . Next you will come to the 
Sirens who beguile all men that approach them . Whoever encounters them unawares and listens to their voices will never joy at reaching home , his wife and children to greet him . 
Instead the Sirens� tempt him with their limpid song , as they sit there in the meadow with a vast heap of mouldering corpses , bones on which hangs the shrivelled skin . 
Plug your comrades� ears with softened beeswax lest they listen , and row swiftly past . 
And if you must hear , then let them first tie you hand and foot and stand you upright in the mast housing , and fasten the rope ends round the mast itself , so you can delight in hearing the Sirens� voices . 
And should you beg your crew to free you , let them only bind you more tightly . / once your comrades have rowed you beyond those creatures I cannot advise you of the best course to take . I will tell you the choice , but you must decide . One leads to sheer cliffs , against which green-eyed 
Amphitrite hurls her vast roaring breakers , the blessed gods call them the 
Wandering rocks . not even birds can pass between them unscathed , not even the timorous rock-doves that bring ambrosia to 
Father 
Zeus . 
The slippery rock always takes one , and 
Zeus must send another to complete their number . Crews that reach the rocks can never escape , instead ships� timbers and human corpses are tossed by the waves or in gushers of cruel fire . 
Only one ocean-going vessel has passed between them , the celebrated 
Argo fleeing from 
Aeetes , and the waves would have quickly broken her on the massive crags , if 
Hera had not seen her through , because of her care for 
Jason . / 
The other course leads to two cliffs , one whose sharp peak towers to the wide heavens . a dark cloud caps it that never vanishes to leave clear skies , even in summer or at harvest . No mortal 
could climb it and set foot on the summit , not though he had twenty hands and feet : the rock is smooth as if it were polished . in the centre of this cliff-face is a dark cave , facing 
West towards Erebus , on the path your hollow ship will take , glorious 
Odysseus , if you listen to my advice . 
Even a man of great strength 
could not shoot an arrow from your vessel as far as that arching cavern . 
Scylla lives there , whose yelp it is true is only that of a new-born whelp , yet she is a foul monster whom not even a god 
could gaze at with pleasure . 
She has twelve flailing legs and six long thin necks , each ending in a savage head with a triple row of close-set teeth masking death�s black void . 
She is sunk to her waist in the echoing cave , but extends her jaws from that menacing chasm , and there she fishes , groping eagerly round the cliff for her catch , dolphins and seals or one of the greater creatures that 
Amphitrite breeds in countless numbers in the moaning depths . No crew passing by in their ship can boast it has ever escaped her unscathed , since each head snatches a man , lifting him from his dark-prowed vessel . / 
Odysseus , you will notice the other cliff is lower , only a bow-shot away , and a great fig-tree with dense leaves grows there . 
Under it divine 
Charybdis swallows the black waters . Three times a day , she spews them out , and three times darkly sucks them back again . No one , not even 
Poseidon , 
could save you from destruction if you are there when she swallows . 
Hug Scylla�s cliff instead , and row your ship past swiftly , since it its better to mourn six men than your whole crew . �� / �So she spoke , but I replied : �Goddess , I beg you to tell me truly why I cannot both escape deadly 
Charybdis and yet defeat 
Scylla when she tries to attack my crew ? � To this the 
Goddess answered : �Resolute man is your heart set again on the toils of battle ? 
Will you not even bow to the deathless gods ? 
Scylla is not mortal . 
She is immortal evil : a dire , ferocious thing of dread . 
You cannot fight her , there is no defence : the only course is flight . if you pause by the rock to arm yourselves , I fear she will dart out and strike you with all six heads again , and seize as many men as at first . Row past at full speed instead , and call to 
Cratais , Scylla�s mother , who bore her to be the bane of mortal men . 
She might keep her from darting out once more . / 
Journeying on you will reach the island of 
Thrinacia , where the Sun-god�s cattle and rich flocks graze : seven herds of kine and as many of sheep , with fifty head per herd . 
They bear no young , but never die , and the goddesses with lovely tresses , the nymphs Phaethusa and 
Lampetia , the daughters of Neaera and 
Helios 
Hyperion , are their shepherdesses . 
When noble Neaera had borne and nursed them , she sent them to remote 
Thrinacia , to tend their father�s sheep and spiral-horned cattle . if you avoid harming the herds , and head straight for home you will suffer yet still see Ithaca . but if you harm them , I prophesy shipwreck for you and your friends , and even if you yourself escape , you will come unlooked-for to your home , in sore distress , losing all comrades . � / as she finished speaking , golden-throned 
Dawn appeared . 
Then the lovely goddess left for home , but I went to the ship and roused my men , and ordered them to embark and loose the hawsers . 
They boarded swiftly and took their place on the benches then sitting in their rows struck the grey water with their oars . 
Circe of the lovely tresses , dread goddess with a human voice , sent us a good companion to help us , a fresh wind from astern of our dark-prowed ship to fill the sail . 
And when we had set the tackle in order fore and aft , we sat down , and let the wind and the helmsman keep her course . / 
Then , troubled at heart , I spoke to the crew : �Friends , it is not right that only one or two of us should know the prophecies of the lovely goddess , 
Circe . I will tell all , so that escaping fate and death or no , at least you are forewarned . 
First she advised us to evade the voices of the marvellous 
Sirens in their flowering meadow . 
She commanded me alone to listen . 
You are to tie me hand and foot and stand me upright in the mast housing , and fasten the rope ends round the mast itself , and if I beg you to free me , bind me yet more tightly . �� / �So I explained everything to my friends , while our well-built vessel , borne on a gentle breeze , quickly neared the island of the 
Sirens . Suddenly the wind dropped , and a breathless calm followed , as some god lulled the waves . 
My comrades rose and furled the sail , then stowed it , then sat to their oars and thrashed the water with the blades of polished pine . I , in the meantime , sliced a large cake of beeswax with my sword-edge , and kneaded the slivers in my strong hands until the pressure and the rays of lord 
Helios 
Hyperion heated it . 
Then I plugged the ears of each of my friends , and they tied me hand and foot and stood me upright in the mast housing , and fastened the rope ends round the mast itself . 
Then sitting down again , they struck the grey water with their oars . / 
We drove past swiftly , but when we were within hail of the shore , the 
Sirens 
could not fail to see our speeding vessel , and began their clear 
singing : �Famous 
Odysseus , great glory of 
Achaea , draw near , and bring your ship to rest , and listen to our voices . No man rows past this isle in his dark ship without hearing the honeysweet sound from our lips . He delights in it and goes his way a wiser man . 
We know all the suffering the 
Argives and the 
Trojans endured , by the gods� will , on the wide plains of 
Troy . 
We know everything that comes to pass on the fertile 
Earth . � / 
This was the haunting song the 
Sirens sang , and I longed to listen , commanding my crew by my expression to set me free . but they bent to their oars and rowed harder , while 
Perimedes and 
Eurylochus rose and tightened my bonds and added more rope . not till they had rowed beyond the 
Sirens , so we no longer heard their voices and song , did my loyal friends clear the wax that plugged their ears , and untie me . � / �No sooner had we left the isle behind than I saw spray , and huge breakers , and heard their thunder . 
The oars springing from my crew�s grasp in their terror slid into the sea , and the ship lost way without my comrades� arms tugging at the tapered blades . Still I paced up and down the deck encouraging them with calm words , speaking to every man in turn : �Friends , we are not unused to trouble : and this hardship is no worse than when the Cyclops used brute strength to pen us in his echoing cave . I used my courage , intelligence and tactics , to get us out of there , and some day these dangers too will be only a memory . 
Now listen to my orders and all obey . stick to your oars and smite the deep sea breakers , and pray that 
Zeus may allow us to run from death . 
Steersman , here are my orders , and take them to heart , since the hollow ship�s steering oar is in your control . 
Keep the ship out of the surf and spray , and hug the cliff , or before you know it the ship will veer to the far side , and plunge us to destruction . � / 
They quickly responded to my words . I chose not to speak of the intractable problem of 
Scylla , lest gripped by terror they left the oars to huddle in the hold . 
And now I forgot Circe�s stern command not to arm myself , instead I donned my splendid armour and grasped two long spears in my hand . 
Then I ran to the foredeck , expecting to see rock-bound 
Scylla first from there bringing disaster to my comrades . but I 
could not sight her and my eyes grew weary searching the mist-draped cliff face . / 
So we sailed on through the narrow straits , crying aloud for fear of 
Scylla on the one hand while divine 
Charybdis sucked the sea in terribly on the other . 
Whenever she spewed it out again , it bubbled and seethed in turmoil like a cauldron on a vast fire , and high overhead the spray rained down on the crags on either side . When she swallowed the seas , her inner vortex 
could be seen , and the rock echoed savagely round about , while below the seabed showed its dark-blue sand . 
My crew turned pale as we gazed at her , fearing destruction , but even as we did so 
Scylla seized six of my strongest and ablest men from the deck . as I looked along the swift ship towards my friends I saw their arms and legs dangling above me . in anguish they cried my name aloud one last time , then each of Scylla�s heads dragged a man writhing towards the rock , as a fisherman on a jutting crag casts his bait to lure small fish , lowers an ox-horn on a long pole into the sea , and catching a fish flings it ashore . 
There at the entrance to her cave she devoured them , as they shrieked and reached out their hands to me in their last dreadful throes . It was the most pitiable sight of all I saw exploring the pathways of the sea . � / �When we had left the cliffs behind , and 
Scylla and 
Charybdis , we came swiftly to 
Helios Hyperion�s lovely island , where the sun-god grazed his fine broad-browed cattle , and his flocks of sturdy sheep . I 
could hear the lowing of cattle as they were stalled and the bleating of sheep from my black ship while I was still at sea , and the blind seer 
Theban Teiresias� words came to mind , with those of 
Aeaean 
Circe , who both warned me to avoid the isle of 
Helios who gives mortals comfort . 
Then troubled at heart I spoke to my men : �Listen , Friends , to words that will distress you . let me tell you the prophecies of 
Teiresias and 
Aeaean 
Circe . 
They clearly warned me to avoid the isle of 
Helios , who comforts mortals : here the greatest danger would lie . 
So , row the black ship on past the island . � / 
My men�s spirits fell at this , and 
Eurylochus replied at once , with fateful words : �Odysseus , you are stronger than us all , with limbs that never weary . It seems you are made of iron and would prevent your friends , exhausted with their efforts and lack of sleep , from landing and making a decent meal on this sea-encircled isle . 
Instead you order us to travel on through advancing night , driven from this island into the misty deep . Night bears the fierce winds that wreck ships . 
How would we escape total destruction if a southerly or a fierce westerly gale sprang up , those that most often sink vessels despite the omnipotent gods ? No , let us give way to dark night , and take our supper on shore by the swift ship , then embark in the morning , and put out once more into the wide waters . � / 
Eurylochus spoke , and the rest of my crew concurred . 
Then I knew some god was set on working harm , and I replied with winged words : �Indeed , you have conquered my lone voice , 
Eurylochus . but let all of you swear me a solemn oath that none of you , his mind clouded with error , will kill a cow or sheep of any herd of cattle or flock we find , but only eat the food deathless 
Circe gave us . � / 
They quickly swore they would do as I commanded . 
And when they had sworn their oath , we moored our fine ship in a deep cove with a spring of sweet water , and the crew went ashore and swiftly prepared a meal . 
When they had quenched their hunger and thirst , they began to grieve for their dear friends whom 
Scylla snatched from the hollow ship and devoured , and as they grieved sweet sleep came upon them . but in the third watch of night , when the stars had begun their descent , 
Zeus the cloud-gatherer stirred a tempestuous wind , and veiled the land and sea with cloud , and all was darkness . as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , we hauled up our ship and made her fast in a flooded cave , where the Nymphs had their seats and a dancing place . 
Then I gathered the men together and addressed them . � / ��Friends , since we have food and drink on board our swift ship let us keep our hands off those cattle lest we come to grief . 
They are the sturdy sheep and cows of 
Helios , a great god , who sees and hears everything . � / 
Their proud hearts conceded me this . but a southerly wind blew for a whole month , and then every breeze was from the east or south . as long as my crew still had bread and red wine they kept their hands from the cattle , valuing their lives . but when all the ship�s stores had gone and they had to hunt for whatever game they 
could find , even fishing with curved hooks their hunger gnawed them so : then I went inland alone to pray to the gods hoping that one would show us how to leave . 
And when I was far enough away from my crew , I cleansed my hands in a place on the island sheltered from the wind , and prayed to all the gods of Olympus . but they shed sweet sleep over my eyelids , while behind me 
Eurylochus was giving my comrades bad advice . �Listen to me , comrades in distress� , he said . �Every form of death is vile to us wretched mortals , but the most wretched way to die is by starvation . 
So , let us cut out the finest of Helios� cattle , and sacrifice to the gods of the wide heavens . 
And if we return to Ithaca , our own land , let us build a fine temple to 
Helios 
Hyperion , and fill it with precious gifts . 
And if he is angered at the loss of his long-horned kine and chooses to wreck our ship , the other gods� agreeing , well for myself I would rather die quickly in the waves , than waste away slowly on a desert island . � / 
The rest of my crew agreed with 
Eurylochus . 
They swiftly corralled the best of Helios� cattle since the fine spiral-horned broad-browed cows were grazing not far from our blue-prowed ship . 
They gathered round them , and prayed to the gods , scattering the new leaves of a tall oak , since they had no white barley left aboard the oared vessel . 
And when they had prayed they slit the cows� throats , flayed them and cut out pieces of thigh which they wrapped in a double layer of fat , laying raw meat on top . as they had no wine to pour on the burning sacrifice , they made libations with water , roasting the entrails on the fire . 
When the thighs were burnt , and they had tasted the inner parts , they carved the rest and spitted it on skewers . / 
Only then did sweet sleep leave my eyes , and I headed back to the swift ship and the shore , but as I drew near the curved vessel the rich scent of hot fat wafted to me , and I groaned aloud and called to the deathless gods : �Father 
Zeus , and you other gods , immortally blessed , you lulled me with cruel sleep to bring about my ruin , so my friends left behind 
could plan this monstrous crime . �� / �Now 
Lampetia of the trailing robes sped swiftly to 
Helios 
Hyperion with the news we had killed his cattle , and deeply angered he complained to the immortals : �Father 
Zeus and you other gods , immortally blessed , take vengeance on the followers of 
Odysseus , Laertes� son . in their insolence , they have killed my cattle : creatures I loved to see when I climbed the starry sky , and when I turned back towards earth again from heaven . if they do not atone for their killing , I will go down to 
Hades and shine for the dead instead . � / At that 
Zeus , the cloud-gatherer , answered : �Helios , don�t stop shining for us immortals , or for mortal men on the fertile 
Earth . as for those culprits I will quickly strike their swift ship with my bright lightning bolt , and shatter it to pieces out on the wine-dark sea . � 
This is what I heard from 
Calypso of the lovely tresses , who said that she herself had heard it from Hermes the 
Messenger . / 
When I reached the ship and the shore , I rebuked my men one by one , but things were beyond remedy , the cattle were already dead . 
The gods at once showed my men dark omens . 
The ox-hides crawled about , raw meat and roast bellowed on the spit , and all around sounded the noise of lowing cattle . 
Nevertheless my faithful comrades feasted for six days on the pick of Helios� cattle they had stolen . 
And when 
Zeus , Cronos� son , brought the seventh day on us , the tempest ceased , and we embarked , and , raising the mast and hoisting the white sail , we put out into open water . / It was not till the island fell astern , and we were out of sight of all but sky and sea , that 
Zeus anchored a black cloud above our hollow ship , and the waves beneath were dark . 
She had not run on for long before there came a howling gale , a tempest out of the west , and the first squall snapped both our forestays , so that the mast toppled backwards and the rigging fell into the hold , while the tip of the mast hitting the stern struck the steersman�s skull and crushed the bones . He plunged like a diver from the deck , and his brave spirit fled the bones . / At that same instant 
Zeus thundered and hurled his lightning at the ship . 
Struck by the bolt she shivered from stem to stern , and filled with sulphurous smoke . 
Falling from the deck , my men floated like sea-gulls in the breakers round the black ship . 
The gods had robbed them of their homecoming . but I ran up and down the ship till a surge ripped the sides from the keel , and drove her on naked , snapping the mast close to the keel . 
The backstay of ox-hide rope lay across the mast , and with it I lashed the keel and mast together , and sitting astride I was carried before the driving wind . / 
Then , would you know , the westerly wind dropped , and a southerly rose swiftly , galling me to the heart lest I retrace our course to meet the whirlpool�s terror . All night I was swept along , and at sunrise was back at Scylla�s rock , and dread 
Charybdis , who swallowed the water round me , but I leapt up , caught at the tall fig tree , and hung there like a bat . I 
could find no foothold , nor climb the tree as its roots were far below me , and its great solid branches that cast shadows on 
Charybdis were out of reach above . 
There I clung grimly , till she spewed out mast and keel again . 
She did , to my delight , but not till that time of day when a judge who handles young litigants� endless quarrels rises from court to find his supper . At that hour the timbers emerged from 
Charybdis . 
Then I let go with hands and feet , and plunged into the water clear of the long spars . 
Then clambering astride them I paddled along with my hands . 
The 
Father of men and gods prevented 
Scylla noticing me , or I would never have escaped utter disaster . / I drifted from there for nine days , and on the tenth night the gods washed me ashore on Ogygia , the home of 
Calypso of the lovely tresses , that dread goddess with a human voice , who cared for me and loved me . but why repeat the story ? 
Only yesterday it was I told it , here in the hall , to yourself and your noble wife . It�s a tedious thing to re-tell a plain-told tale . � / �Leaving the river of 
Ocean , and crossing the wide sea waves , we came again to the Isle of 
Aeaea , where

The oars springing from my crew�s grasp in their terror slid into the sea , and the ship lost way without my comrades� arms tugging at the tapered blades . Still I paced up and down the deck encouraging them with calm words , speaking to every man in turn : �Friends , we are not unused to trouble : and this hardship is no worse than when the Cyclops used brute strength to pen us in his echoing cave . I used my courage , intelligence and tactics , to get us out of there , and some day these dangers too will be only a memory . 
Now listen to my orders and all obey . stick to your oars and smite the deep sea breakers , and pray that 
Zeus may allow us to run from death . 
Steersman , here are my orders , and take them to heart , since the hollow ship�s steering oar is in your control . 
Keep the ship out of the surf and spray , and hug the cliff , or before you know it the ship will veer to the far side , and plunge us to destruction . � / 
They quickly responded to my words . I chose not to speak of the intractable problem of 
Scylla , lest gripped by terror they left the oars to huddle in the hold . 
And now I forgot Circe�s stern command not to arm myself , instead I donned my splendid armour and grasped two long spears in my hand . 
Then I ran to the foredeck , expecting to see rock-bound 
Scylla first from there bringing disaster to my comrades . but I 
could not sight her and my eyes grew weary searching the mist-draped cliff face . / 
So we sailed on through the narrow straits , crying aloud for fear of 
Scylla on the one hand while divine 
Charybdis sucked the sea in terribly on the other . 
Whenever she spewed it out again , it bubbled and seethed in turmoil like a cauldron on a vast fire , and high overhead the spray rained down on the crags on either side . When she swallowed the seas , her inner vortex 
could be seen , and the rock echoed savagely round about , while below the seabed showed its dark-blue sand . 
My crew turned pale as we gazed at her , fearing destruction , but even as we did so 
Scylla seized six of my strongest and ablest men from the deck . as I looked along the swift ship towards my friends I saw their arms and legs dangling above me . in anguish they cried my name aloud one last time , then each of Scylla�s heads dragged a man writhing towards the rock , as a fisherman on a jutting crag casts his bait to lure small fish , lowers an ox-horn on a long pole into the sea , and catching a fish flings it ashore . 
There at the entrance to her cave she devoured them , as they shrieked and reached out their hands to me in their last dreadful throes . It was the most pitiable sight of all I saw exploring the pathways of the sea . � / �When we had left the cliffs behind , and 
Scylla and 
Charybdis , we came swiftly to 
Helios Hyperion�s lovely island , where the sun-god grazed his fine broad-browed cattle , and his flocks of sturdy sheep . I 
could hear the lowing of cattle as they were stalled and the bleating of sheep from my black ship while I was still at sea , and the blind seer 
Theban Teiresias� words came to mind , with those of 
Aeaean 
Circe , who both warned me to avoid the isle of 
Helios who gives mortals comfort . 
Then troubled at heart I spoke to my men : �Listen , Friends , to words that will distress you . let me tell you the prophecies of 
Teiresias and 
Aeaean 
Circe . 
They clearly warned me to avoid the isle of 
Helios , who comforts mortals : here the greatest danger would lie . 
So , row the black ship on past the island . � / 
My men�s spirits fell at this , and 
Eurylochus replied at once , with fateful words : �Odysseus , you are stronger than us all , with limbs that never weary . It seems you are made of iron and would prevent your friends , exhausted with their efforts and lack of sleep , from landing and making a decent meal on this sea-encircled isle . 
Instead you order us to travel on through advancing night , driven from this island into the misty deep . Night bears the fierce winds that wreck ships . 
How would we escape total destruction if a southerly or a fierce westerly gale sprang up , those that most often sink vessels despite the omnipotent gods ? No , let us give way to dark night , and take our supper on shore by the swift ship , then embark in the morning , and put out once more into the wide waters . � / 
Eurylochus spoke , and the rest of my crew concurred . 
Then I knew some god was set on working harm , and I replied with winged words : �Indeed , you have conquered my lone voice , 
Eurylochus . but let all of you swear me a solemn oath that none of you , his mind clouded with error , will kill a cow or sheep of any herd of cattle or flock we find , but only eat the food deathless 
Circe gave us . � / 
They quickly swore they would do as I commanded . 
And when they had sworn their oath , we moored our fine ship in a deep cove with a spring of sweet water , and the crew went ashore and swiftly prepared a meal . 
When they had quenched their hunger and thirst , they began to grieve for their dear friends whom 
Scylla snatched from the hollow ship and devoured , and as they grieved sweet sleep came upon them . but in the third watch of night , when the stars had begun their descent , 
Zeus the cloud-gatherer stirred a tempestuous wind , and veiled the land and sea with cloud , and all was darkness . as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , we hauled up our ship and made her fast in a flooded cave , where the Nymphs had their seats and a dancing place . 
Then I gathered the men together and addressed them . � / ��Friends , since we have food and drink on board our swift ship let us keep our hands off those cattle lest we come to grief . 
They are the sturdy sheep and cows of 
Helios , a great god , who sees and hears everything . � / 
Their proud hearts conceded me this . but a southerly wind blew for a whole month , and then every breeze was from the east or south . as long as my crew still had bread and red wine they kept their hands from the cattle , valuing their lives . but when all the ship�s stores had gone and they had to hunt for whatever game they 
could find , even fishing with curved hooks their hunger gnawed them so : then I went inland alone to pray to the gods hoping that one would show us how to leave . 
And when I was far enough away from my crew , I cleansed my hands in a place on the island sheltered from the wind , and prayed to all the gods of Olympus . but they shed sweet sleep over my eyelids , while behind me 
Eurylochus was giving my comrades bad advice . �Listen to me , comrades in distress� , he said . �Every form of death is vile to us wretched mortals , but the most wretched way to die is by starvation . 
So , let us cut out the finest of Helios� cattle , and sacrifice to the gods of the wide heavens . 
And if we return to Ithaca , our own land , let us build a fine temple to 
Helios 
Hyperion , and fill it with precious gifts . 
And if he is angered at the loss of his long-horned kine and chooses to wreck our ship , the other gods� agreeing , well for myself I would rather die quickly in the waves , than waste away slowly on a desert island . � / 
The rest of my crew agreed with 
Eurylochus . 
They swiftly corralled the best of Helios� cattle since the fine spiral-horned broad-browed cows were grazing not far from our blue-prowed ship . 
They gathered round them , and prayed to the gods , scattering the new leaves of a tall oak , since they had no white barley left aboard the oared vessel . 
And when they had prayed they slit the cows� throats , flayed them and cut out pieces of thigh which they wrapped in a double layer of fat , laying raw meat on top . as they had no wine to pour on the burning sacrifice , they made libations with water , roasting the entrails on the fire . 
When the thighs were burnt , and they had tasted the inner parts , they carved the rest and spitted it on skewers . / 
Only then did sweet sleep leave my eyes , and I headed back to the swift ship and the shore , but as I drew near the curved vessel the rich scent of hot fat wafted to me , and I groaned aloud and called to the deathless gods : �Father 
Zeus , and you other gods , immortally blessed , you lulled me with cruel sleep to bring about my ruin , so my friends left behind 
could plan this monstrous crime . �� / �Now 
Lampetia of the trailing robes sped swiftly to 
Helios 
Hyperion with the news we had killed his cattle , and deeply angered he complained to the immortals : �Father 
Zeus and you other gods , immortally blessed , take vengeance on the followers of 
Odysseus , Laertes� son . in their insolence , they have killed my cattle : creatures I loved to see when I climbed the starry sky , and when I turned back towards earth again from heaven . if they do not atone for their killing , I will go down to 
Hades and shine for the dead instead . � / At that 
Zeus , the cloud-gatherer , answered : �Helios , don�t stop shining for us immortals , or for mortal men on the fertile 
Earth . as for those culprits I will quickly strike their swift ship with my bright lightning bolt , and shatter it to pieces out on the wine-dark sea . � 
This is what I heard from 
Calypso of the lovely tresses , who said that she herself had heard it from Hermes the 
Messenger . / 
When I reached the ship and the shore , I rebuked my men one by one , but things were beyond remedy , the cattle were already dead . 
The gods at once showed my men dark omens . 
The ox-hides crawled about , raw meat and roast bellowed on the spit , and all around sounded the noise of lowing cattle . 
Nevertheless my faithful comrades feasted for six days on the pick of Helios� cattle they had stolen . 
And when 
Zeus , Cronos� son , brought the seventh day on us , the tempest ceased , and we embarked , and , raising the mast and hoisting the white sail , we put out into open water . / It was not till the island fell astern , and we were out of sight of all but sky and sea , that 
Zeus anchored a black cloud above our hollow ship , and the waves beneath were dark . 
She had not run on for long before there came a howling gale , a tempest out of the west , and the first squall snapped both our forestays , so that the mast toppled backwards and the rigging fell into the hold , while the tip of the mast hitting the stern struck the steersman�s skull and crushed the bones . He plunged like a diver from the deck , and his brave spirit fled the bones . / At that same instant 
Zeus thundered and hurled his lightning at the ship . 
Struck by the bolt she shivered from stem to stern , and filled with sulphurous smoke . 
Falling from the deck , my men floated like sea-gulls in the breakers round the black ship . 
The gods had robbed them of their homecoming . but I ran up and down the ship till a surge ripped the sides from the keel , and drove her on naked , snapping the mast close to the keel . 
The backstay of ox-hide rope lay across the mast , and with it I lashed the keel and mast together , and sitting astride I was carried before the driving wind . / 
Then , would you know , the westerly wind dropped , and a southerly rose swiftly , galling me to the heart lest I retrace our course to meet the whirlpool�s terror . All night I was swept along , and at sunrise was back at Scylla�s rock , and dread 
Charybdis , who swallowed the water round me , but I leapt up , caught at the tall fig tree , and hung there like a bat . I 
could find no foothold , nor climb the tree as its roots were far below me , and its great solid branches that cast shadows on 
Charybdis were out of reach above . 
There I clung grimly , till she spewed out mast and keel again . 
She did , to my delight , but not till that time of day when a judge who handles young litigants� endless quarrels rises from court to find his supper . At that hour the timbers emerged from 
Charybdis . 
Then I let go with hands and feet , and plunged into the water clear of the long spars . 
Then clambering astride them I paddled along with my hands . 
The 
Father of men and gods prevented 
Scylla noticing me , or I would never have escaped utter disaster . / I drifted from there for nine days , and on the tenth night the gods washed me ashore on Ogygia , the home of 
Calypso of the lovely tresses , that dread goddess with a human voice , who cared for me and loved me . but why repeat the story ? 
Only yesterday it was I told it , here in the hall , to yourself and your noble wife . It�s a tedious thing to re-tell a plain-told tale . � /
