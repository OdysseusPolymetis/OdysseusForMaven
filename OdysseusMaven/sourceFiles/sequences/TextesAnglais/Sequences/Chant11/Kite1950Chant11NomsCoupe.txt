�On reaching the shore , 
we dragged the vessel down to the glittering sea , and set up mast and sail in our black ship . 
Then 
we hauled the sheep aboard , and embarked ourselves , weeping , shedding huge tears . 
Still , 
Circe of the lovely tresses , dread goddess with a human voice , sent us a good companion to help us , a fresh wind from astern of our dark-prowed ship to fill the sail . 
And when 
we had set the tackle in order fore and aft , 
we sat down , and let the wind and the helmsman keep her course . All day long with straining sail she glided over the sea , till the sun set and all the waves grew dark . / 
So she came to the deep flowing 
Ocean that surrounds the earth , and the 
city and country of the 
Cimmerians , wrapped in cloud and mist . The bright sun never shines down on them with his rays neither by climbing the starry heavens nor turning back again towards earth , but instead dreadful 
Night looms over a wretched people . 
There 
we beached our ship , and landed the sheep , and made our way along the 
Ocean stream , till 
we came to the place 
Circe described . / 
Perimedes and Eurylochus restrained the sacrificial victims while I drew my sharp sword from its sheath , and with it dug a pit two foot square , then poured a libation all around to the dead , first of milk and honey , then of sweet wine , thirdly of water , sprinkled with white barley meal . 
Then I prayed devoutly to the powerless ghosts of the departed , swearing that when I reached Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer in my palace , the best of the herd , and would heap the altar with rich spoils , and offer a ram , apart , to 
Teiresias , the finest jet-black ram in the flock . 
When , with prayers and vows , I had invoked the hosts of the dead , I led the sheep to the pit and cut their throats , so the dark blood flowed . / 
Then the ghosts of the dead swarmed out of Erebus � brides , and young men yet unwed , old men worn out with toil , girls once vibrant and still new to grief , and ranks of warriors slain in battle , showing their wounds from bronze-tipped spears , their armour stained with blood . round the pit from every side the crowd thronged , with strange cries , and I turned pale with fear . 
Then I called to my comrades , and told them to flay and burn the sheep killed by the pitiless bronze , with prayers to the divinities , to 
mighty 
Hades and dread 
Persephone . I myself , drawing my sharp sword from its sheath , sat there preventing the powerless ghosts from drawing near to the blood , till I might question 
Teiresias . � / �The first ghost to appear was that of my comrade 
Elpenor . 
He had not yet been buried beneath the broad-tracked earth , for 
we left his corpse behind in Circe�s hall , unburied and unwept , while another more urgent task drove us on . I wept now when I saw him , and pitied him , and I spoke to him with winged words : �Elpenor , how came you here , to the gloomy dark ? 
You are here sooner on foot than I in my black ship . � / At this he groaned and answered me , saying : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes some god�s hostile decree was my undoing , and too much wine . I lay down to sleep in Circe�s house , and forgetting the way down by the long ladder fell headlong from the roof . 
My neck was shattered where it joins the spine : and my ghost descended , to the house of 
Hades . I know as you go from here , from Hades� house , your good ship will touch again at Aeaea�s Isle , and I beg you , by those , our absent ones 
we left behind , by your wife , by your father who cared for you as a child , by your only son Telemachus forsaken in your halls , I beg you , my lord , remember me . 
When you sail from there , do not leave me behind , unwept , unburied , and turn away , lest I prove a source of divine anger against you . 
Burn me , with whatever armour I own , and heap up a mound for me on the grey sea�s shore , in memory of a man of no fortune , that I may be known by those yet to be . do this for me and on my mound raise the oar I rowed with alive and among my friends . � / 
He spoke , and I replied : �Man of no fortune , all this I will remember to do . � 
So 
we sat , exchanging joyless words , I on one side of the trench , holding my sword above the blood , my friend�s ghost on the other , pouring out his speech . / 
Then there appeared the soul of my dead mother , 
Anticleia , daughter of noble 
Autolycus : she who was still alive when I left to sail for sacred 
Troy . I wept at the sight of her , and my heart was filled with pity , yet I could not let her approach the blood , despite my grief , till I had questioned 
Teiresias . � / �Then the ghost of 
Theban 
Teiresias appeared , carrying his golden staff , ad he knew me , and spoke : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , how now , luckless man ? 
Why have you left the sunlight , to view the dead in this joyless place ? 
Move back from the trench and turn aside your blade so I may drink the blood , and prophesy truth to you . � / At this , I drew back and sheathed my silver-embossed sword . 
When he had drunk the black blood , the infallible seer spoke and said : �Noble 
Odysseus , you ask about your sweet homecoming , but the god will make it a bitter journey . I think you will not escape the 
Earth-Shaker , who is angered at heart against you , angered because you blinded his son . Even so , though you shall suffer , you and your friends may yet reach home when you have sailed your good ship to the island of 
Thrinacia , and escaped the dark blue sea , and found there the cattle and the fat flocks of 
Helios , he who sees and hears everything , if only you can control your own and your comrades� greed . if you keep your hands off them , and think only of your homeward course , you may yet reach Ithaca , though you will suffer . but if you lay hands on them , then I foresee shipwreck for you and your friends , and even if you yourself escape , you will come unlooked-for to your home , in sore distress , losing all comrades , in another�s vessel , to find great trouble in your house , insolent men who destroy your goods , who court your wife and offer gifts of courtship . / 
Yet , I speak truth , when you arrive there you will take revenge on them for their outrages . 
When , though , you have killed the 
Suitors in your palace , by cunning or openly , with your sharp sword , then pick up a shapely oar and travel on till you come to a race that knows nothing of the sea , that eat no salt with their food , and have never heard of crimson-painted ships , or the well-shaped oars that serve as wings . 
And let this be your sign , you cannot miss it : that meeting another traveller he will say you carry a winnowing-fan on your 
broad shoulder . 
There you must plant your shapely oar in the ground , and make rich sacrifice to lord 
Poseidon , a ram , a bull , and a breeding-boar . 
Then leave for home , and make sacred offerings there to the deathless gods who hold the wide heavens , to all of them , and in their due order . / 
And death will come to you far from the sea , the gentlest of deaths , taking you when you are bowed with comfortable old age , and your people prosperous about you . This that I speak to you is the truth . � / 
He finished , and I replied , saying : �Teiresias , no doubt the gods , themselves , have spun this fate for me . 
Come tell me the truth of this now . Here I see my dead mother�s ghost : she sits beside the blood silently , and cannot look on her own son�s face or speak with him . tell me , my lord , how she may know it is I . � / 
Swiftly he answered my words : �It is a simple thing to explain to you . 
Whoever of the dead departed you allow to approach the blood will speak to you indeed : but whoever you deny will draw back . �� / �With this the ghost of lord 
Teiresias , its prophecy complete , drew back to the house of 
Hades . but I remained , undaunted , till my mother approached and drank the black blood . 
Then she knew me , and in sorrow spoke to me with winged words : �My son , how do you come , living , to the gloomy dark ? 
It is difficult for those alive to find these realms , since there are great rivers and dreadful waters between us : not least 
Ocean that no man can cross except in a well-made ship . do you only now come from 
Troy , after long wandering with your ship and crew ? have you not been to Ithaca yet , not seen your wife and home ? � / To this I replied : �Mother , necessity brought me to Hades� house , to hear the ghost of 
Theban 
Teiresias , and his prophecy . No , I have not yet neared Achaea�s shores , not set foot in my own country , but have wandered constantly , burdened with trouble , from the day I left for ilium , the 
city famous for horses , with noble 
Agamemnon , to fight the 
Trojans . but tell me now , in truth , what pitiless fate overtook you ? 
Was it a wasting disease , or did 
Artemis of the 
Bow attack you with her gentle arrows , and kill you ? 
And what of my father and son I left behind ? Does my realm still rest with them , or has some other man possessed it , saying I will no longer return ? 
And tell me of my wife , her thoughts and intentions . 
Is she still with her son , and all safe ? or has whoever is best among the 
Achaeans wedded her ? � / 
So I spoke , and my revered mother swiftly replied : �Truly , that loyal heart still lives in your palace , and in weeping the days and night pass sadly for her . No man has taken your noble realm , as yet , and Telemachus holds the land unchallenged , feasting at the banquets of his peers , at least those it is fitting for a maker of laws to share , since all men invite him . but your father lives alone in the fields , not travelling to the 
city , and owns no bed with bright rugs and cloaks for bedding , but sleeps where serfs sleep , in the ashes by the hearth all winter through , and wears only simple clothes . 
When summer comes and mellow autumn , then you will find his humble beds of fallen leaves , scattered here and there on the vineyard�s slopes . 
There he lies , burdened with age , grieving , nursing great sadness in his heart , longing for your return . 
So too fate brought me to the grave . 
It was not the clear-sighted 
Goddess of the 
Bow who slew me in the palace with gentle arrows , nor did I die of some disease , one of those that often steals the body�s strength , and wastes us wretchedly . No , what robbed me of my life and its honeyed sweetness was yearning for you , my glorious 
Odysseus , for your kindness and your counsels . � / 
So she spoke , and I wondered how I might embrace my dead mother�s ghost . Three times my will urged me to clasp her , and I started towards her , three times she escaped my arms like a shadow or a dream . 
And the pain seemed deeper in my heart . 
Then I spoke to her with winged words : �Mother , since I wish it why do you not let me embrace you , so that even in Hades� house 
we might clasp our arms around each other and sate ourselves with chill lament ? are you a mere phantom royal 
Persephone has sent , to make me groan and grieve the more ? / 
My revered mother replied quickly : �Oh , my child , most unfortunate of men , 
Persephone , Zeus� daughter , does not deceive you : this is the way it is with mortals after death . The sinews no longer bind flesh and bone , the fierce heat of the blazing pyre consumes them , and the spirit flees from our white bones , a ghost that flutters and goes like a dream . 
Hasten to the light , with all speed : remember these things , to speak to your wife of them . �� / �So 
we talked together , and then the women , the wives and daughters of heroes came , sent by royal 
Persephone . a crowd they thronged around the black blood , and I considered how best to question them , and this was my idea : to draw my long sword from its sheath , and prevent them drinking of the blood together . 
Then each came forward , one by one , and declared her lineage , and I questioned all . / 
Know then , the first I saw was noble 
Tyro , who told me she was peerless Salmoneus� daughter , and wife to 
Cretheus , Aeolus� son . 
She fell in love with the god of the river Enipeus , most beautiful of Earth�s rivers , and used to wander by its lovely waters . but the 
Earth-Shaker , 
Earth-Bearer 
Poseidon , took Enipeus� form , and lay with her at the eddying river-mouth . a dark wave , mountain-high , curled over them , and hid the mortal woman and the god . 
There he unclasped the virgin�s girdle , and then he sealed her eyes in sleep . 
When he had finished making love to her , he took her by the hand , and said : �Lady , be happy in this love of ours , and as the year progresses you will bear glorious children , for a god�s embrace is not without power . nurse them and rear them , but for now go home and keep silent , and know I am 
Poseidon , the 
Earth-Shaker . � 
With this he sank beneath the surging sea . 
Tyro 
conceived , and bore 
Pelias and 
Neleus , two 
mighty servants of great 
Zeus . 
Pelias , rich in flocks , lived in spacious 
Iolcus , while 
Neleus lived in sandy 
Pylos . This queen among women bore other children to 
Cretheus : 
Aeson , 
Pheres and 
Amythaon , filled with the charioteer�s delight in battle . / Next I saw 
Antiope , Asopus� daughter , who claimed she had slept with 
Zeus himself . 
She gave birth to two sons , 
Amphion and 
Zethus , who 
founded 
Seven-Gated 
Thebes , ringing it with walls , since powerful as they were they could not live in a 
Thebes vast but unfortified . / 
Then came 
Alcmene , wife of amphitryon , who 
conceived 
Heracles , lion-hearted , fierce in fight , when she lay in great Zeus� arms . 
And I saw 
Megara , proud Creon�s daughter , who married that same indomitable son of amphitryon . / 
Then Oedipus� mother came , the beautiful 
Jocasta , who unknowingly did a monstrous thing : she wed her own son . 
He killed his father and married his mother : only then did the gods reveal the truth . by the gods� dark design despite his suffering he still ruled the 
Cadmeans in lovely 
Thebes , but she descended to the house of 
Hades , 
mighty jailor , tying a fatal noose to the high ceiling , hung by her own grief , leaving endless pain for 
Oedipus , all that a mother�s avenging furies can inflict . / 
And lovely 
Chloris I saw , youngest daughter of 
Amphion , son of 
Iasus once the great 
Minyan 
King of Orchomenus . 
Neleus wooing her gave her countless gifts , marrying her because of her beauty : and she was 
Queen in 
Pylos . 
She bore her husband glorious children , 
Nestor , 
Chromius , and noble Periclymenus , and the lovely Pero , she a wonder to men , so that all her neighbours tried for her hand , but 
Neleus would only give her to the man who could drive great Iphicles� cattle from 
Phylace : a 
broad and spiral-horned herd , and hard to drive . The infallible prophet , 
Melampus , alone , agreed to try , but the gods� dark design snared him , and the savage herdsmen�s cruel bonds . 
Only when days and months had passed , the seasons had altered , and a new year came , did 
mighty Iphicles release him , since he had exhausted all his prophecies , and Zeus� will was done . / 
Leda , I saw , Tyndareus� wife , who bore him those stout-hearted twins , castor , the horse-tamer , and Polydeuces , the boxer . 
Though they still live , they have even been honoured by 
Zeus in the underworld , beneath the fruitful 
Earth . Each alternately is alive for a day , and the next day that one is dead : they are honoured as if they were gods . / Next I saw 
Iphimedeia , 
Aloeus wife , who claimed she had slept with 
Poseidon . 
She too bore twins , short-lived , 
godlike 
Otus and famous 
Ephialtes , the tallest most handsome men by far , bar great 
Orion , whom the fertile 
Earth ever nourished . 
They were fifteen feet wide , and fifty feet high at nine years old , and threatened to sound the battle-cry of savage war even against the 
Olympian gods . 
They longed to add 
Ossa to 
Olympus , then Pelion and its waving woods to 
Ossa , and scale the heavens themselves . 
They would have done it too , if they had already reached manhood , but 
Apollo , Zeus� son , born of lovely 
Leto , slew them both , before the down had covered their faces , and their beards began to grow . / 
And Phaedra too I saw , and Procris , and fair 
Ariadne , daughter of baleful 
Minos . 
Theseus tried to carry her off from 
Crete to the sacred hill of 
Athens , but had no joy , for 
Artemis , warned by 
Dionysus , killed her on sea-encircled dia . / 
And 
Maera came , and 
Clymene , and hateful Eriphyle , who sold her own husband�s life for gold . / I cannot count or name all the wives and daughters of heroes I saw there , or all this immortal night would be gone . 
And it is time for me to sleep , here in the palace , or with my crew by the swift ship . 
My journey home is in your hands , and in the hands of the gods . � / 
So 
Odysseus spoke . 
Spellbound at his words , all had fallen silent in the darkened hall . White-armed 
Arete was the first of the gathering to speak : �Phaeacians , what do you think of this man�s looks , his stature , and judgement ? 
He is my guest , as well , though you all share in that honour . 
So don�t be in a hurry to send him on his way , nor fail in generosity to one who stands in need , for favoured by the gods your homes are full of treasures . � / 
Then a 
Phaeacian elder , the aged hero Echeneus , said : �Friends , our wise queen�s words are fitting and match our thoughts . Respond to them , though words and actions here are still subject to 
Alcinous . � / �Her word is good , � 
Alcinous replied , �as long as I live and rule the sea-loving 
Phaeacians . 
Yet our guest must stay until tomorrow , despite his longing for home , while 
we add to our gifts . The men shall concern themselves , all of them , with his passage , I most of all , since the power here rests with me . � / 
Then resourceful 
Odysseus replied : �Renowned 
Alcinous , my lord , if you further my passage and offer me glorious gifts , though you commanded me to stay , even for another year , I would accept it . 
It would be better to reach my country with full hands . I would win more honour and love from those who witness my return to Ithaca . � / 
Again 
Alcinous spoke : �Odysseus , when 
we gaze at you , 
we certainly do not think of you as one of those liars and cheats the black earth breeds in such numbers among the ranks of humankind , men who fashion falsehoods out of things beyond experience . 
You have a wise and eloquent heart , and have told us your adventures and of the Argives� sad misfortunes with the skilfulness of a bard . but tell me the truth of this , in 
Hades did you see any of your 
godlike comrades , warriors who travelled to 
Troy with you , and met their death there ? The night is long , and it cannot be time to sleep yet , not on such a marvellous night as this . tell me the wondrous things you have done . I could stay awake till shining dawn , listening as long as you are willing to speak of your misfortunes . � / To this resourceful 
Odysseus answered : �Lord 
Alcinous , most renowned of men , there is a time for words , and a time for sleep . but if you long to hear I cannot refuse to speak of a sadder thing than these , the fate of friends who escaped the dread ranks of the 
Trojans only to die later , to die on their return through an evil woman�s wiles . � / �When sacred 
Persephone had dispersed the female spirits , the ghost of 
Agamemnon , son of 
Atreus , came sorrowing , and other ghosts were gathered round him , those who met their fate alongside him , murdered in Aegisthus� palace . 
Drinking the black blood he knew me , and wept loudly , shedding great tears , stretching his hands out in his eagerness to touch me . but all his power and strength was gone , all that vigour his body one possessed . / I wept when I saw him , and pitied him , and spoke to him with winged words : �Agamemnon , king of men , glorious son of 
Atreus , what pitiless stroke of fate destroyed you ? 
Did 
Poseidon stir the cruel winds to a raging tempest , and swamp your ships ? or perhaps you were attacked in enemy country , while you were driving off their cattle and fine flocks , or fighting to take their 
city and its women ? � / 
He answered my words swiftly : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , 
Poseidon stirred no cruel winds to raging tempest , nor swamped my ships , nor was I attacked in enemy country . 
Aegisthus it was who engineered my fate , inviting me to his palace for a feast , murdering me with my accursed wife�s help , as you might kill an ox in its stall . I died wretchedly , and round me my companions were slaughtered ruthlessly , like white-tusked swine for a wedding banquet in the hall of some rich and powerful man , or at a communal meal , or a great drinking session . 
You yourself have witnessed the killing of men , in single combat or in the thick of the fight , but you would have felt the deepest pity at that sight , the floor swimming with blood where our corpses lay , by the mixing bowl and the heavily-laden tables . but the most pitiful cry of all came from 
Cassandra , Priam�s daughter , whom treacherous Clytemnestra killed as she clung to me . Brought low by Aegisthus� sword I tried to lift my arms in dying , but bitch that she was my wife turned away , and though I was going to Hades� halls she disdained even to close my eyelids or my mouth . 
Truly there is nothing more terrible or shameless than a woman who can contemplate such acts , planning and executing a husband�s murder . I had thought to be welcomed by my house and children , but she with her mind intent on that final horror has brought shame on herself and all future women , even those who are virtuous . � / To this I answered : �Indeed , from the very beginning , 
Zeus the Thunderer has tormented the race of 
Atreus , through women�s machinations ! 
So many men died for Helen�s sake while Clytemnestra plotted in your absence . � I spoke , and he made answer swiftly : �So don�t be too open with your own wife , don�t tell her every thought in your mind , reveal a part , keep the rest to yourself . not that death will come to you from wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , she who is so tender-hearted , and circumspect . a newly 
wedded bride she was when we left for the war , with a baby son at her breast who must be a man now and prospering . 
His loving father will see him when he returns , and he will kiss his father as is right and proper . but that wife of mine did not even allow me to set eyes on my son before she killed me . let me say this too , and take my words to heart , don�t bring your ship to anchor openly , when you reach home , but do it secretly , since women can no longer be trusted . / 
Come tell me , in truth , have you heard if my son is still alive , maybe in Orchomenus or sandy 
Pylos , or in Menelaus� 
broad 
Sparta : that my noble 
Orestes is not yet dead ? � To this I answered : �Son of 
Atreus , why ask this of me ? I cannot tell if he is dead or living , and it is wrong to utter empty words . �� / �So 
we stood , exchanging words of sadness , grieving and shedding tears . 
And now the spirit of 
Achilles son of Peleus appeared , and the spirits of Patroclus and peerless Antilochus , and ajax who for beauty and stature was supreme among the 
Danaans , save only for Peleus� flawless son . 
And the ghost of swift-footed 
Achilles , grandson of 
Aeacus , knew me , and spoke through the tears : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , what could your resolute mind devise that exceeds this : to dare to descend to 
Hades , where live the heedless dead , the disembodied ghosts of men ? � / 
So he spoke , and I replied : �Achilles , son of Peleus , greatest of 
Achaean warriors , I came to find 
Teiresias , to see if he would show me the way to reach rocky Ithaca . I have not yet touched 
Achaea , not set foot in my own land , but have suffered endless troubles , yet no man has been more blessed than you , 
Achilles , nor will be in time to come , since 
we 
Argives considered you a god while you lived , and now you rule , a power , among the un-living . do not grieve , then , 
Achilles , at your death . � / 
These words he answered , swiftly : �Glorious 
Odysseus : don�t try to reconcile me to my dying . I�d rather serve as another man�s labourer , as a poor peasant without land , and be alive on 
Earth , than be lord of all the lifeless dead . Give me news of my son , instead . 
Did he follow me to war , and become a leader ? tell me , too , what you know of noble Peleus . 
Is he honoured still among the myrmidons , or because old age ties him hand and foot do Hellas and Phthia fail to honour him . I am no longer up there in the sunlight to help him with that strength I had on Troy�s wide plain , where I killed the flower of their host to defend the 
Argives . if I could only return strong to my father�s house , for a single hour , I would give those who abuse him and his honour cause to regret the power of my invincible hands . � / To this I answered : �Truly , I have heard nothing of faultless Peleus , but I can tell you all about 
Neoptolemus , your resolute son , since you command me . I myself brought him from 
Scyros , in my well-made hollow ship , to join the bronze-greaved ranks of the 
Acheans . 
When 
we debated our plans before 
Troy he was always first to speak and his words were eloquent : only 
godlike 
Nestor and I were more so . 
And when 
we fought with our bronze spears on the plains of 
Troy , he never lagged behind in the crowded ranks but always advanced far in the lead , yielding to no one in skill . 
Many were the men he killed in mortal combat . I could not count or name them , all those victims of his , killed as he fought for the 
Argives , but what a warrior that hero 
Eurypylus , son of 
Telephus was , who fell to his sword , and Eurypylus� 
Mysian comrades slain around him , all because of a woman�s desire for gain . / Next to noble 
Memnon , he was the handsomest man I ever saw . 
Then again , when 
we 
Argive leaders climbed into the Horse that 
Epeius made , and it fell to me to open the hatch of our well-made hiding place , or keep it closed , the other 
Danaan generals and counsellors kept on wiping the tears from their eyes and their limbs trembled , but he begged me endlessly to let him leap from the Horse , toying with his sword hilt and his heavy bronze spear , eager to wreak havoc on the 
Trojans . 
And when 
we had sacked Priam�s high 
city , he took ship with his share of the spoils and a noble prize , and never a wound , untouched by the sharp spears , unmarked by close combat , something rare in battle , since ares , the 
God of 
War , is indiscriminate in his fury . � / 
When I had spoken , the spirit of 
Achilles , Aeacus� grandson , went away with great strides through the field of asphodel , rejoicing at my news of his son�s greatness . � / �The other ghosts of the dead departed stood there sorrowing , and each asked me about their dear ones . 
Only the spirit of ajax , Telamon�s son , stood apart , still angered over my victory in the contest by the ships , for Achilles� weapons . Achilles� divine mother , 
Thetis , had offered them as a prize , with the 
Trojan prisoners and 
Pallas 
Athene herself as judges . I wish I had never won the reward for that debate , that armour that caused the earth to close over so noble a head as that of ajax , who in beauty and martial action was supreme among the 
Danaans , save for that faultless son of Peleus . I spoke to his ghost in calming words : �Ajax , son of faultless 
Telamon , even in death can you not forget your anger with me , over those fatal weapons ? The gods themselves must have cursed the 
Argives with them . in you a to
wer of strength was lost to us , and we 
Achaeans never cease to share as great a grief for you , as 
we do for 
Achilles , Peleus� son . but 
Zeus alone is to blame whose deadly hatred for the 
Danaan host hastened your doom . 
Come closer to me , my lord , so you can hear my speech . 
Curb your wrath : restrain your proud spirit . � / 
He chose not to give a single word in answer , but went his way into Erebus to join the other ghosts of the dead departed . for all his anger he might still have spoken to me , or I to him , but my heart desired to see other ghosts of those who were gone . / 
Know that I saw 
Minos there , Zeus� glorious son , seated with the golden sceptre in his hand , passing judgement on the dead as they sat or stood around him , making their case , in the broad-gated house of 
Hades . / I next saw great 
Orion , carrying his indestructible bronze club , driving the phantoms of wild creatures he once killed in the lonely hills over the fields of asphodel . / I saw 
Tityos , son of glorious 
Gaea , spread out over a hundred yards of ground , while a vulture sat on either side tearing his liver , plucking at his entrails , his hands powerless to beat them away . 
He is punished for his rape of 
Leto , Zeus� honoured consort , as she journeyed to 
Pytho through lovely Panopeus . / I saw Tantalus in agonising torment , in a pool of water reaching to his chin . 
He was tortured by thirst , but could not drink , since every time he stooped eagerly the water was swallowed up and vanished , and at his feet only black earth remained , parched by some god . fruit hung from the boughs of tall leafy trees , pears and pomegranates , juicy apples , sweet figs and ripe olives . but whenever the old man reached towards them to grasp them in his hands , the wind would sweep them off into the shadowy clouds . � / �And I saw 
Sisyphus in agonising torment trying to roll a huge stone to the top of a hill . 
He would brace himself , and push it towards the summit with both hands , but just as he was about to heave it over the crest its weight overcame him , and then down again to the plain came bounding that pitiless boulder . 
He would wrestle again , and lever it back , while the sweat poured from his limbs , and the dust swirled round his head . / 
Then I caught sight of 
mighty 
Heracles , I mean his phantom , since he joys in feasting among the deathless gods , with slim-ankled Hebe for wife , she the daughter of great 
Zeus and golden-sandalled 
Hera . round 
Heracles a clamour rose from the dead , like wild birds flying up in terror , and he dark as night , his bow unsheathed and an arrow strung , glared round fiercely as if about to shoot . 
His golden shoulder-belt was terrifying too , where marvellous things were wrought , bears , wild boars , lions with glittering eyes , battle and conflict , murder and mayhem . I hope that whatever craftsman retained the design of that belt he never made another , and never will . / 
When he saw me , he in turn knew me , and weeping spoke in winged words : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , wretched spirit are you too playing out your evil fate such as I once endured under the sun ? a son of 
Zeus , Cronos� son , I still suffered misery beyond all measure , since I served a man far inferior to me , and he set me difficult tasks . 
He even sent me here to bring back the 
Hound of 
Hades , unable to think of a harder labour . I carried off the creature too , and led him away . 
Hermes and bright-eyed 
Athene were my guides . � / 
With this he departed into Hades� house , but I stood fast , hoping some other heroic warrior of ancient times might still appear . 
And I might have seen those men of the past I longed to see , 
Theseus and Peirithous , bright sons of the gods . but long before that the countless hosts of the dead came thronging with eerie cries , and I was gripped by pale fear lest royal 
Persephone send up the head of that ghastly monster , the 
Gorgon , from Hades� house . / 
So I hastened to the ship , and ordered my friends to embark , and let loose the cables . 
Swiftly they climbed aboard , and took their seats at the oars , and as 
we rowed the force of the current carried her down the river of 
Ocean , till afterwards a fair breeze blew . / �On reaching the shore , 
we dragged the vessel down to the glittering sea , and set up mast and sail in our black ship . 
Then 
we hauled the sheep aboard , and embarked ourselves , weeping , shedding huge tears . 
Still , 
Circe of the lovely tresses , dread goddess with a human voice , sent us a good companion to help us , a fresh wind from astern of our dark-prowed ship to fill the sail . 
And when 
we had set the tackle in order fore and aft , 
we sat down , and let the wind and the helmsman keep her course . All day long with straining sail she glided over the sea , till the sun set and all the waves grew dark . / 
So she came to the deep flowing 
Ocean that surrounds the earth , and the 
city and country of the 
Cimmerians , wrapped in cloud and mist . The bright sun never shines down on them with his rays neither by climbing the starry heavens nor turning back again towards earth , but instead dreadful 
Night looms over a wretched people . 
There 
we beached our ship , and landed the sheep , and made our way along the 
Ocean stream , till 
we came to the place 
Circe described . / 
Perimedes and Eurylochus restrained the sacrificial victims while I drew my sharp sword from its sheath , and with it dug a pit two foot square , then poured a libation all around to the dead , first of milk and honey , then of sweet wine , thirdly of water , sprinkled with white barley meal . 
Then I prayed devoutly to the powerless ghosts of the departed , swearing that when I reached Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer in my palace , the best of the herd , and would heap the altar with rich spoils , and offer a ram , apart , to 
Teiresias , the finest jet-black ram in the flock . 
When , with prayers and vows , I had invoked the hosts of the dead , I led the sheep to the pit and cut their throats , so the dark blood flowed . / 
Then the ghosts of the dead swarmed out of Erebus � brides , and young men yet unwed , old men worn out with toil , girls once vibrant and still new to grief , and ranks of warriors slain in battle , showing their wounds from bronze-tipped spears , their armour stained with blood . round the pit from every side the crowd thronged , with strange cries , and I turned pale with fear . 
Then I called to my comrades , and told them to flay and burn the sheep killed by the pitiless bronze , with prayers to the divinities , to 
mighty 
Hades and dread 
Persephone . I myself , drawing my sharp sword from its sheath , sat there preventing the powerless ghosts from drawing near to the blood , till I might question 
Teiresias . � / �The first ghost to appear was that of my comrade 
Elpenor . 
He had not yet been buried beneath the broad-tracked earth , for 
we left his corpse behind in Circe�s hall , unburied and unwept , while another more urgent task drove us on . I wept now when I saw him , and pitied him , and I spoke to him with winged words : �Elpenor , how came you here , to the gloomy dark ? 
You are here sooner on foot than I in my black ship . � / At this he groaned and answered me , saying : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes some god�s hostile decree was my undoing , and too much wine . I lay down to sleep in Circe�s house , and forgetting the way down by the long ladder fell headlong from the roof . 
My neck was shattered where it joins the spine : and my ghost descended , to the house of 
Hades . I know as you go from here , from Hades� house , your good ship will touch again at Aeaea�s Isle , and I beg you , by those , our absent ones 
we left behind , by your wife , by your father who cared for you as a child , by your only son Telemachus forsaken in your halls , I beg you , my lord , remember me . 
When you sail from there , do not leave me behind , unwept , unburied , and turn away , lest I prove a source of divine anger against you . 
Burn me , with whatever armour I own , and heap up a mound for me on the grey sea�s shore , in memory of a man of no fortune , that I may be known by those yet to be . do this for me and on my mound raise the oar I rowed with alive and among my friends . � / 
He spoke , and I replied : �Man of no fortune , all this I will remember to do . � 
So 
we sat , exchanging joyless words , I on one side of the trench , holding my sword above the blood , my friend�s ghost on the other , pouring out his speech . / 
Then there appeared the soul of my dead mother , 
Anticleia , daughter of noble 
Autolycus : she who was still alive when I left to sail for sacred 
Troy . I wept at the sight of her , and my heart was filled with pity , yet I could not let her approach the blood , despite my grief , till I had questioned 
Teiresias . � / �Then the ghost of 
Theban 
Teiresias appeared , carrying his golden staff , ad he knew me , and spoke : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , how now , luckless man ? 
Why have you left the sunlight , to view the dead in this joyless place ? 
Move back from the trench and turn aside your blade so I may drink the blood , and prophesy truth to you . � / At this , I drew back and sheathed my silver-embossed sword . 
When he had drunk the black blood , the infallible seer spoke and said : �Noble 
Odysseus , you ask about your sweet homecoming , but the god will make it a bitter journey . I think you will not escape the 
Earth-Shaker , who is angered at heart against you , angered because you blinded his son . Even so , though you shall suffer , you and your friends may yet reach home when you have sailed your good ship to the island of 
Thrinacia , and escaped the dark blue sea , and found there the cattle and the fat flocks of 
Helios , he who sees and hears everything , if only you can control your own and your comrades� greed . if you keep your hands off them , and think only of your homeward course , you may yet reach Ithaca , though you will suffer . but if you lay hands on them , then I foresee shipwreck for you and your friends , and even if you yourself escape , you will come unlooked-for to your home , in sore distress , losing all comrades , in another�s vessel , to find great trouble in your house , insolent men who destroy your goods , who court your wife and offer gifts of courtship . / 
Yet , I speak truth , when you arrive there you will take revenge on them for their outrages . 
When , though , you have killed the 
Suitors in your palace , by cunning or openly , with your sharp sword , then pick up a shapely oar and travel on till you come to a race that knows nothing of the sea , that eat no salt with their food , and have never heard of crimson-painted ships , or the well-shaped oars that serve as wings . 
And let this be your sign , you cannot miss it : that meeting another traveller he will say you carry a winnowing-fan on your 
broad shoulder . 
There you must plant your shapely oar in the ground , and make rich sacrifice to lord 
Poseidon , a ram , a bull , and a breeding-boar . 
Then leave for home , and make sacred offerings there to the deathless gods who hold the wide heavens , to all of them , and in their due order . / 
And death will come to you far from the sea , the gentlest of deaths , taking you when you are bowed with comfortable old age , and your people prosperous about you . This that I speak to you is the truth . � / 
He finished , and I replied , saying : �Teiresias , no doubt the gods , themselves , have spun this fate for me . 
Come tell me the truth of this now . Here I see my dead mother�s ghost : she sits beside the blood silently , and cannot look on her own son�s face or speak with him . tell me , my lord , how she may know it is I . � / 
Swiftly he answered my words : �It is a simple thing to explain to you . 
Whoever of the dead departed you allow to approach the blood will speak to you indeed : but whoever you deny will draw back . �� / �With this the ghost of lord 
Teiresias , its prophecy complete , drew back to the house of 
Hades . but I remained , undaunted , till my mother approached and drank the black blood . 
Then she knew me , and in sorrow spoke to me with winged words : �My son , how do you come , living , to the gloomy dark ? 
It is difficult for those alive to find these realms , since there are great rivers and dreadful waters between us : not least 
Ocean that no man can cross except in a well-made ship . do you only now come from 
Troy , after long wandering with your ship and crew ? have you not been to Ithaca yet , not seen your wife and home ? � / To this I replied : �Mother , necessity brought me to Hades� house , to hear the ghost of 
Theban 
Teiresias , and his prophecy . No , I have not yet neared Achaea�s shores , not set foot in my own country , but have wandered constantly , burdened with trouble , from the day I left for ilium , the 
city famous for horses , with noble 
Agamemnon , to fight the 
Trojans . but tell me now , in truth , what pitiless fate overtook you ? 
Was it a wasting disease , or did 
Artemis of the 
Bow attack you with her gentle arrows , and kill you ? 
And what of my father and son I left behind ? Does my realm still rest with them , or has some other man possessed it , saying I will no longer return ? 
And tell me of my wife , her thoughts and intentions . 
Is she still with her son , and all safe ? or has whoever is best among the 
Achaeans wedded her ? � / 
So I spoke , and my revered mother swiftly replied : �Truly , that loyal heart still lives in your palace , and in weeping the days and night pass sadly for her . No man has taken your noble realm , as yet , and Telemachus holds the land unchallenged , feasting at the banquets of his peers , at least those it is fitting for a maker of laws to share , since all men invite him . but your father lives alone in the fields , not travelling to the 
city , and owns no bed with bright rugs and cloaks for bedding , but sleeps where serfs sleep , in the ashes by the hearth all winter through , and wears only simple clothes . 
When summer comes and mellow autumn , then you will find his humble beds of fallen leaves , scattered here and there on the vineyard�s slopes . 
There he lies , burdened with age , grieving , nursing great sadness in his heart , longing for your return . 
So too fate brought me to the grave . 
It was not the clear-sighted 
Goddess of the 
Bow who slew me in the palace with gentle arrows , nor did I die of some disease , one of those that often steals the body�s strength , and wastes us wretchedly . No , what robbed me of my life and its honeyed sweetness was yearning for you , my glorious 
Odysseus , for your kindness and your counsels . � / 
So she spoke , and I wondered how I might embrace my dead mother�s ghost . Three times my will urged me to clasp her , and I started towards her , three times she escaped my arms like a shadow or a dream . 
And the pain seemed deeper in my heart . 
Then I spoke to her with winged words : �Mother , since I wish it why do you not let me embrace you , so that even in Hades� house 
we might clasp our arms around each other and sate ourselves with chill lament ? are you a mere phantom royal 
Persephone has sent , to make me groan and grieve the more ? / 
My revered mother replied quickly : �Oh , my child , most unfortunate of men , 
Persephone , Zeus� daughter , does not deceive you : this is the way it is with mortals after death . The sinews no longer bind flesh and bone , the fierce heat of the blazing pyre consumes them , and the spirit flees from our white bones , a ghost that flutters and goes like a dream . 
Hasten to the light , with all speed : remember these things , to speak to your wife of them . �� / �So 
we talked together , and then the women , the wives and daughters of heroes came , sent by royal 
Persephone . a crowd they thronged around the black blood , and I considered how best to question them , and this was my idea : to draw my long sword from its sheath , and prevent them drinking of the blood together . 
Then each came forward , one by one , and declared her lineage , and I questioned all . / 
Know then , the first I saw was noble 
Tyro , who told me she was peerless Salmoneus� daughter , and wife to 
Cretheus , Aeolus� son . 
She fell in love with the god of the river Enipeus , most beautiful of Earth�s rivers , and used to wander by its lovely waters . but the 
Earth-Shaker , 
Earth-Bearer 
Poseidon , took Enipeus� form , and lay with her at the eddying river-mouth . a dark wave , mountain-high , curled over them , and hid the mortal woman and the god . 
There he unclasped the virgin�s girdle , and then he sealed her eyes in sleep . 
When he had finished making love to her , he took her by the hand , and said : �Lady , be happy in this love of ours , and as the year progresses you will bear glorious children , for a god�s embrace is not without power . nurse them and rear them , but for now go home and keep silent , and know I am 
Poseidon , the 
Earth-Shaker . � 
With this he sank beneath the surging sea . 
Tyro 
conceived , and bore 
Pelias and 
Neleus , two 
mighty servants of great 
Zeus . 
Pelias , rich in flocks , lived in spacious 
Iolcus , while 
Neleus lived in sandy 
Pylos . This queen among women bore other children to 
Cretheus : 
Aeson , 
Pheres and 
Amythaon , filled with the charioteer�s delight in battle . / Next I saw 
Antiope , Asopus� daughter , who claimed she had slept with 
Zeus himself . 
She gave birth to two sons , 
Amphion and 
Zethus , who 
founded 
Seven-Gated 
Thebes , ringing it with walls , since powerful as they were they could not live in a 
Thebes vast but unfortified . / 
Then came 
Alcmene , wife of amphitryon , who 
conceived 
Heracles , lion-hearted , fierce in fight , when she lay in great Zeus� arms . 
And I saw 
Megara , proud Creon�s daughter , who married that same indomitable son of amphitryon . / 
Then Oedipus� mother came , the beautiful 
Jocasta , who unknowingly did a monstrous thing : she wed her own son . 
He killed his father and married his mother : only then did the gods reveal the truth . by the gods� dark design despite his suffering he still ruled the 
Cadmeans in lovely 
Thebes , but she descended to the house of 
Hades , 
mighty jailor , tying a fatal noose to the high ceiling , hung by her own grief , leaving endless pain for 
Oedipus , all that a mother�s avenging furies can inflict . / 
And lovely 
Chloris I saw , youngest daughter of 
Amphion , son of 
Iasus once the great 
Minyan 
King of Orchomenus . 
Neleus wooing her gave her countless gifts , marrying her because of her beauty : and she was 
Queen in 
Pylos . 
She bore her husband glorious children , 
Nestor , 
Chromius , and noble Periclymenus , and the lovely Pero , she a wonder to men , so that all her neighbours tried for her hand , but 
Neleus would only give her to the man who could drive great Iphicles� cattle from 
Phylace : a 
broad and spiral-horned herd , and hard to drive . The infallible prophet , 
Melampus , alone , agreed to try , but the gods� dark design snared him , and the savage herdsmen�s cruel bonds . 
Only when days and months had passed , the seasons had altered , and a new year came , did 
mighty Iphicles release him , since he had exhausted all his prophecies , and Zeus� will was done . / 
Leda , I saw , Tyndareus� wife , who bore him those stout-hearted twins , castor , the horse-tamer , and Polydeuces , the boxer . 
Though they still live , they have even been honoured by 
Zeus in the underworld , beneath the fruitful 
Earth . Each alternately is alive for a day , and the next day that one is dead : they are honoured as if they were gods . / Next I saw 
Iphimedeia , 
Aloeus wife , who claimed she had slept with 
Poseidon . 
She too bore twins , short-lived , 
godlike 
Otus and famous 
Ephialtes , the tallest most handsome men by far , bar great 
Orion , whom the fertile 
Earth ever nourished . 
They were fifteen feet wide , and fifty feet high at nine years old , and threatened to sound the battle-cry of savage war even against the 
Olympian gods . 
They longed to add 
Ossa to 
Olympus , then Pelion and its waving woods to 
Ossa , and scale the heavens themselves . 
They would have done it too , if they had already reached manhood , but 
Apollo , Zeus� son , born of lovely 
Leto , slew them both , before the down had covered their faces , and their beards began to grow . / 
And Phaedra too I saw , and Procris , and fair 
Ariadne , daughter of baleful 
Minos . 
Theseus tried to carry her off from 
Crete to the sacred hill of 
Athens , but had no joy , for 
Artemis , warned by 
Dionysus , killed her on sea-encircled dia . / 
And 
Maera came , and 
Clymene , and hateful Eriphyle , who sold her own husband�s life for gold . / I cannot count or name all the wives and daughters of heroes I saw there , or all this immortal night would be gone . 
And it is time for me to sleep , here in the palace , or with my crew by the swift ship . 
My journey home is in your hands , and in the hands of the gods . � / 
So 
Odysseus spoke . 
Spellbound at his words , all had fallen silent in the darkened hall . White-armed 
Arete was the first of the gathering to speak : �Phaeacians , what do you think of this man�s looks , his stature , and judgement ? 
He is my guest , as well , though you all share in that honour . 
So don�t be in a hurry to send him on his way , nor fail in generosity to one who stands in need , for favoured by the gods your homes are full of treasures . � / 
Then a 
Phaeacian elder , the aged hero Echeneus , said : �Friends , our wise queen�s words are fitting and match our thoughts . Respond to them , though words and actions here are still subject to 
Alcinous . � / �Her word is good , � 
Alcinous replied , �as long as I live and rule the sea-loving 
Phaeacians . 
Yet our guest must stay until tomorrow , despite his longing for home , while 
we add to our gifts . The men shall concern themselves , all of them , with his passage , I most of all , since the power here rests with me . � / 
Then resourceful 
Odysseus replied : �Renowned 
Alcinous , my lord , if you further my passage and offer me glorious gifts , though you commanded me to stay , even for another year , I would accept it . 
It would be better to reach my country with full hands . I would win more honour and love from those who witness my return to Ithaca . � / 
Again 
Alcinous spoke : �Odysseus , when 
we gaze at you , 
we certainly do not think of you as one of those liars and cheats the black earth breeds in such numbers among the ranks of humankind , men who fashion falsehoods out of things beyond experience . 
You have a wise and eloquent heart , and have told us your adventures and of the Argives� sad misfortunes with the skilfulness of a bard . but tell me the truth of this , in 
Hades did you see any of your 
godlike comrades , warriors who travelled to 
Troy with you , and met their death there ? The night is long , and it cannot be time to sleep yet , not on such a marvellous night as this . tell me the wondrous things you have done . I could stay awake till shining dawn , listening as long as you are willing to speak of your misfortunes . � / To this resourceful 
Odysseus answered : �Lord 
Alcinous , most renowned of men , there is a time for words , and a time for sleep . but if you long to hear I cannot refuse to speak of a sadder thing than these , the fate of friends who escaped the dread ranks of the 
Trojans only to die later , to die on their return through an evil woman�s wiles . � / �When sacred 
Persephone had dispersed the female spirits , the ghost of 
Agamemnon , son of 
Atreus , came sorrowing , and other ghosts were gathered round him , those who met their fate alongside him , murdered in Aegisthus� palace . 
Drinking the black blood he knew me , and wept loudly , shedding great tears , stretching his hands out in his eagerness to touch me . but all his power and strength was gone , all that vigour his body one possessed . / I wept when I saw him , and pitied him , and spoke to him with winged words : �Agamemnon , king of men , glorious son of 
Atreus , what pitiless stroke of fate destroyed you ? 
Did 
Poseidon stir the cruel winds to a raging tempest , and swamp your ships ? or perhaps you were attacked in enemy country , while you were driving off their cattle and fine flocks , or fighting to take their 
city and its women ? � / 
He answered my words swiftly : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , 
Poseidon stirred no cruel winds to raging tempest , nor swamped my ships , nor was I attacked in enemy country . 
Aegisthus it was who engineered my fate , inviting me to his palace for a feast , murdering me with my accursed wife�s help , as you might kill an ox in its stall . I died wretchedly , and round me my companions were slaughtered ruthlessly , like white-tusked swine for a wedding banquet in the hall of some rich and powerful man , or at a communal meal , or a great drinking session . 
You yourself have witnessed the killing of men , in single combat or in the thick of the fight , but you would have felt the deepest pity at that sight , the floor swimming with blood where our corpses lay , by the mixing bowl and the heavily-laden tables . but the most pitiful cry of all came from 
Cassandra , Priam�s daughter , whom treacherous Clytemnestra killed as she clung to me . Brought low by Aegisthus� sword I tried to lift my arms in dying , but bitch that she was my wife turned away , and though I was going to Hades� halls she disdained even to close my eyelids or my mouth . 
Truly there is nothing more terrible or shameless than a woman who can contemplate such acts , planning and executing a husband�s murder . I had thought to be welcomed by my house and children , but she with her mind intent on that final horror has brought shame on herself and all future women , even those who are virtuous . � / To this I answered : �Indeed , from the very beginning , 
Zeus the Thunderer has tormented the race of 
Atreus , through women�s machinations ! 
So many men died for Helen�s sake while Clytemnestra plotted in your absence . � I spoke , and he made answer swiftly : �So don�t be too open with your own wife , don�t tell her every thought in your mind , reveal a part , keep the rest to yourself . not that death will come to you from wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , she who is so tender-hearted , and circumspect . a newly 
wedded bride she was when we left for the war , with a baby son at her breast who must be a man now and prospering . 
His loving father will see him when he returns , and he will kiss his father as is right and proper . but that wife of mine did not even allow me to set eyes on my son before she killed me . let me say this too , and take my words to heart , don�t bring your ship to anchor openly , when you reach home , but do it secretly , since women can no longer be trusted . / 
Come tell me , in truth , have you heard if my son is still alive , maybe in Orchomenus or sandy 
Pylos , or in Menelaus� 
broad 
Sparta : that my noble 
Orestes is not yet dead ? � To this I answered : �Son of 
Atreus , why ask this of me ? I cannot tell if he is dead or living , and it is wrong to utter empty words . �� / �So 
we stood , exchanging words of sadness , grieving and shedding tears . 
And now the spirit of 
Achilles son of Peleus appeared , and the spirits of Patroclus and peerless Antilochus , and ajax who for beauty and stature was supreme among the 
Danaans , save only for Peleus� flawless son . 
And the ghost of swift-footed 
Achilles , grandson of 
Aeacus , knew me , and spoke through the tears : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , what could your resolute mind devise that exceeds this : to dare to descend to 
Hades , where live the heedless dead , the disembodied ghosts of men ? � / 
So he spoke , and I replied : �Achilles , son of Peleus , greatest of 
Achaean warriors , I came to find 
Teiresias , to see if he would show me the way to reach rocky Ithaca . I have not yet touched 
Achaea , not set foot in my own land , but have suffered endless troubles , yet no man has been more blessed than you , 
Achilles , nor will be in time to come , since 
we 
Argives considered you a god while you lived , and now you rule , a power , among the un-living . do not grieve , then , 
Achilles , at your death . � / 
These words he answered , swiftly : �Glorious 
Odysseus : don�t try to reconcile me to my dying . I�d rather serve as another man�s labourer , as a poor peasant without land , and be alive on 
Earth , than be lord of all the lifeless dead . Give me news of my son , instead . 
Did he follow me to war , and become a leader ? tell me , too , what you know of noble Peleus . 
Is he honoured still among the myrmidons , or because old age ties him hand and foot do Hellas and Phthia fail to honour him . I am no longer up there in the sunlight to help him with that strength I had on Troy�s wide plain , where I killed the flower of their host to defend the 
Argives . if I could only return strong to my father�s house , for a single hour , I would give those who abuse him and his honour cause to regret the power of my invincible hands . � / To this I answered : �Truly , I have heard nothing of faultless Peleus , but I can tell you all about 
Neoptolemus , your resolute son , since you command me . I myself brought him from 
Scyros , in my well-made hollow ship , to join the bronze-greaved ranks of the 
Acheans . 
When 
we debated our plans before 
Troy he was always first to speak and his words were eloquent : only 
godlike 
Nestor and I were more so . 
And when 
we fought with our bronze spears on the plains of 
Troy , he never lagged behind in the crowded ranks but always advanced far in the lead , yielding to no one in skill . 
Many were the men he killed in mortal combat . I could not count or name them , all those victims of his , killed as he fought for the 
Argives , but what a warrior that hero 
Eurypylus , son of 
Telephus was , who fell to his sword , and Eurypylus� 
Mysian comrades slain around him , all because of a woman�s desire for gain . / Next to noble 
Memnon , he was the handsomest man I ever saw . 
Then again , when 
we 
Argive leaders climbed into the Horse that 
Epeius made , and it fell to me to open the hatch of our well-made hiding place , or keep it closed , the other 
Danaan generals and counsellors kept on wiping the tears from their eyes and their limbs trembled , but he begged me endlessly to let him leap from the Horse , toying with his sword hilt and his heavy bronze spear , eager to wreak havoc on the 
Trojans . 
And when 
we had sacked Priam�s high 
city , he took ship with his share of the spoils and a noble prize , and never a wound , untouched by the sharp spears , unmarked by close combat , something rare in battle , since ares , the 
God of 
War , is indiscriminate in his fury . � / 
When I had spoken , the spirit of 
Achilles , Aeacus� grandson , went away with great strides through the field of asphodel , rejoicing at my news of his son�s greatness . � / �The other ghosts of the dead departed stood there sorrowing , and each asked me about their dear ones . 
Only the spirit of ajax , Telamon�s son , stood apart , still angered over my victory in the contest by the ships , for Achilles� weapons . Achilles� divine mother , 
Thetis , had offered them as a prize , with the 
Trojan prisoners and 
Pallas 
Athene herself as judges . I wish I had never won the reward for that debate , that armour that caused the earth to close over so noble a head as that of ajax , who in beauty and martial action was supreme among the 
Danaans , save for that faultless son of Peleus . I spoke to his ghost in calming words : �Ajax , son of faultless 
Telamon , even in death can you not forget your anger with me , over those fatal weapons ? The gods themselves must have cursed the 
Argives with them . in you a to
wer of strength was lost to us , and we 
Achaeans never cease to share as great a grief for you , as 
we do for 
Achilles , Peleus� son . but 
Zeus alone is to blame whose deadly hatred for the 
Danaan host hastened your doom . 
Come closer to me , my lord , so you can hear my speech . 
Curb your wrath : restrain your proud spirit . � / 
He chose not to give a single word in answer , but went his way into Erebus to join the other ghosts of the dead departed . for all his anger he might still have spoken to me , or I to him , but my heart desired to see other ghosts of those who were gone . / 
Know that I saw 
Minos there , Zeus� glorious son , seated with the golden sceptre in his hand , passing judgement on the dead as they sat or stood around him , making their case , in the broad-gated house of 
Hades . / I next saw great 
Orion , carrying his indestructible bronze club , driving the phantoms of wild creatures he once killed in the lonely hills over the fields of asphodel . / I saw 
Tityos , son of glorious 
Gaea , spread out over a hundred yards of ground , while a vulture sat on either side tearing his liver , plucking at his entrails , his hands powerless to beat them away . 
He is punished for his rape of 
Leto , Zeus� honoured consort , as she journeyed to 
Pytho through lovely Panopeus . / I saw Tantalus in agonising torment , in a pool of water reaching to his chin . 
He was tortured by thirst , but could not drink , since every time he stooped eagerly the water was swallowed up and vanished , and at his feet only black earth remained , parched by some god . fruit hung from the boughs of tall leafy trees , pears and pomegranates , juicy apples , sweet figs and ripe olives . but whenever the old man reached towards them to grasp them in his hands , the wind would sweep them off into the shadowy clouds . � / �And I saw 
Sisyphus in agonising torment trying to roll a huge stone to the top of a hill . 
He would brace himself , and push it towards the summit with both hands , but just as he was about to heave it over the crest its weight overcame him , and then down again to the plain came bounding that pitiless boulder . 
He would wrestle again , and lever it back , while the sweat poured from his limbs , and the dust swirled round his head . / 
Then I caught sight of 
mighty 
Heracles , I mean his phantom , since he joys in feasting among the deathless gods , with slim-ankled Hebe for wife , she the daughter of great 
Zeus and golden-sandalled 
Hera . round 
Heracles a clamour rose from the dead , like wild birds flying up in terror , and he dark as night , his bow unsheathed and an arrow strung , glared round fiercely as if about to shoot . 
His golden shoulder-belt was terrifying too , where marvellous things were wrought , bears , wild boars , lions with glittering eyes , battle and conflict , murder and mayhem . I hope that whatever craftsman retained the design of that belt he never made another , and never will . / 
When he saw me , he in turn knew me , and weeping spoke in winged words : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , wretched spirit are you too playing out your evil fate such as I once endured under the sun ? a son of 
Zeus , Cronos� son , I still suffered misery beyond all measure , since I served a man far inferior to me , and he set me difficult tasks . 
He even sent me here to bring back the 
Hound of 
Hades , unable to think of a harder labour . I carried off the creature too , and led him away . 
Hermes and bright-eyed 
Athene were my guides . � / 
With this he departed into Hades� house , but I stood fast , hoping some other heroic warrior of ancient times might still appear . 
And I might have seen those men of the past I longed to see , 
Theseus and Peirithous , bright sons of the gods . but long before that the countless hosts of the dead came thronging with eerie cries , and I was gripped by pale fear lest royal 
Persephone send up the head of that ghastly monster , the 
Gorgon , from Hades� house . / 
So I hastened to the ship , and ordered my friends to embark , and let loose the cables . 
Swiftly they climbed aboard , and took their seats at the oars , and as 
we rowed the force of the current carried her down the river of 
Ocean , till afterwards a fair breeze blew . /
