back at the hut , 
Odysseus and the noble swineherd had lit a dawn fire , and were making breakfast , after sending the other herdsmen off with the swine . as 
Telemachus 
approached , the guard dogs failed to bark , instead 
they fawned around him . 
Odysseus , hearing the sound of footsteps and realising the dogs were silent , spoke to 
Eumaeus with winged words : �This must be some friend of yours , 
Eumaeus , or an old acquaintance . I hear footsteps , but the dogs are quiet , fawning round your visitor . � / 
He had barely finished speaking when his own brave son stood on the threshold . 
The swineherd leapt up in amazement , and the bowls he was using to mix the glowing wine fell from his hands . 
He ran to meet his master , and kissed his forehead , his sparkling eyes , and his hands , while the tears ran down his cheeks . 
The worthy swineherd clasped godlike 
Telemachus in his arms and kissed him endlessly as if he were back from the dead , as a loving 
father greets a son returned from a far-off land after a nine-year absence , a dear and only son for whom he has suffered much pain . 
And , in tears , he spoke to him with winged words : � / �Telemachus , sweet light of my eyes , you are here ! 
And I thought I would never see you more , after you sailed for 
Pylos . 
Come in , dear boy , and let me gladden my heart by gazing at you , home now from distant lands , and here , in my house . 
You seldom visit the herdsmen and the farm : you are always in town : I think you must enjoy watching that hateful crowd of 
Suitors . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �If you say so , old friend . I came here to see you , though , with my own eyes , and ask you whether my mother is still at home , or whether some man has married her leaving Odysseus� bed un-slept in , hung with foul cobwebs . � / �Truly , � the master swineherd replied , �she still suffers patiently in the palace , and while she weeps the nights and days pass by in sadness . � 
With this he took the bronze spear from 
Telemachus , who crossed the stone threshold . 
His 
father , 
Odysseus , rose at his approach to relinquish his chair , but 
Telemachus stopped him with a sign , and 
said : �Sit down , friend , and I�ll find a seat here elsewhere . Here�s a man who�ll find one for me . � 
With this , 
Odysseus sat down again , while the swineherd threw a fleece over a pile of brushwood so that Odysseus� steadfast son could be seated . 
Then the swineherd set out plates of roast meat from the previous day�s meal , and baskets piled with bread , and mixed honeyed wine in an ivy bowl , before sitting down opposite godlike 
Odysseus . / 
They stretched out their hands to the good food in front of them , and when 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , 
Telemachus asked the worthy swineherd : �Where does this stranger hail from , old friend ? 
What ship brought him to Ithaca and who did the sailors claim to be , since he couldn�t get here on foot ? � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered him , saying : �I�ll tell you all about it , my boy . 
He says he was born on Crete�s broad island , and has roamed through all the cities of men : such is the fate a god has spun for him . 
Now he�s escaped a 
Thresprotian ship and found his way to the farm . I�ll entrust him to you , to do as you wish , as he is your suppliant . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �Eumaeus your words cut me to the quick . 
How can I welcome a stranger to my house ? I am still young , and not strong enough to defend myself against anyone who picks a quarrel at random . 
And my mother�s mind sways this way and that , whether to stay and keep house for me out of respect for her husband�s bed and for public opinion , or to go with whoever proves best of the 
Achaean suitors , and offers the finest marriage gifts . in truth , regarding this stranger , since he has come to you I will give him a fine tunic and cloak , a double-edged sword and a pair of sandals , and send him on wherever he�s minded to go . or you might wish to keep him on at the farm , and take care of him : I�ll send you clothes and sufficient food , so his presence doesn�t ruin you . but I�ll not let him mix with the crowd of 
Suitors , whose mindless insolence runs to excess , lest 
they taunt him , and distress me . It�s hard for one man alone to do anything in a crowd , however brave he is . 
They have the greater strength , in truth . � / �Friend , � 
said noble long-suffering 
Odysseus , �it is surely right for me to speak . 
It pains my heart to hear you describe the outrage these 
Suitors commit in your house , to spite you , a fine man . do you accept it ? do the people here hate you , because of some oracle ? or is it the fault of some brother , whom a man should trust to fight for him in troubled times . I wish I had the youth to match my present feelings , or were myself a son of peerless 
Odysseus , or even 
Odysseus himself returned from his travels , of which there�s always hope . 
Then some stranger would be welcome to take my head if I failed to prove their bane when I reached the palace of Laertes� son . 
And if 
they proved too many for a lone fighter , then if it were me I�d rather die the death in my own palace , than have to gaze forever at wickedness , strangers maltreated , the maids shamefully manhandled in those fine halls , wine wasted , and men gorging themselves on my food , endlessly , without care or restraint . � / �Stranger , � wise 
Telemachus replied , �let me confess the truth of the matter . on the whole the people have no hatred for me or grudge against me , nor is it the fault of any brother a man should trust to fight for him in troubled times . 
Zeus has preserved our house in a strict line . 
Laertes was Arceisius� only son , 
Odysseus in turn was his , and I am Odysseus� . 
He had little joy of me , leaving me behind , a child , in his palace . as a result the house is full of enemies . 
All the princes who rule the islands , 
Dulichium , 
Same , and wooded 
Zacynthus , and those here in rocky Ithaca , all of them court my mother , and plunder my house . 
She neither rejects their wooing outright , nor chooses to accept re-marriage , the idea of which she hates , while 
they consume my stores in feasting , and will ruin me before long . 
Yet all that�s in the lap of the gods , old friend : go quickly and tell faithful 
Penelope that I am safely back from 
Pylos . I will wait here till you have told her your news , in private , and returned . No one else must hear it , since many of them are hostile to me . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered him then , saying : �I hear you , and I�ll bear it in mind , you are speaking to one who understands . but tell me , now , shall I visit 
Laertes at the same time . 
That man of ill fate continued to manage the estate for a while , and ate and drank with the men , when the spirit took him , though grieving deeply for 
Odysseus . but since you left in your ship for 
Pylos 
they say he no longer eats or drinks , or oversees the work , but sits there groaning and weeping , nothing but skin and bone . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �We�re the sadder for that , but nevertheless we will let him alone , regardless of our sorrow . if it were possible for us mortals to have every wish fulfilled , our priority should be my father�s return above all . No , speak your message and hurry back , and don�t wander the fields in search of 
Laertes . tell my mother instead to send her maid to him , quickly and secretly : she can take the old man the news . � / 
He sent the swineherd on his way , then picked up his sandals and bound them to his feet , and headed for town . 
Athene , aware of Eumaeus� departure from the farm 
approached in the form of a tall , beautiful woman , skilled in fine handiwork . 
She stood by the entrance to the hut and was visible to 
Odysseus , but 
Telemachus failed to see or be aware of her : since the gods do not show themselves openly to all . 
The dogs , as well as 
Odysseus , saw her though , and slunk away whining , not barking , to the far side of the yard . 
She raised her eyebrows and seeing her signal 
Odysseus went out past the wall of the court and stood there , facing her . 
Then 
Athene spoke to him : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , tell your son who you are no longer hide it , and when you have planned how to kill the 
Suitors , go on towards town . I will not be far from you , I am eager for the fight . � / 
Saying this , 
Athene touched him with her golden wand . 
She clothed him in a clean tunic and cloak , increased his stature , and restored his youthful complexion . 
His colour returned , his cheeks filled out , and his beard darkened . 
Then she departed , leaving 
Odysseus to return to the hut . 
There his son was amazed , and troubled , dropping his gaze , fearing he was in the presence of a god . 
He spoke with winged words : �Stranger , you seem different now than you were a moment ago . 
Your clothes are new , and your complexion has changed . 
Surely you are one of the gods that rule the wide heavens ? Be gracious , and spare us , and let us offer you fitting sacrifice , and fine gifts wrought with gold . � / noble long-suffering 
Odysseus replied : �I am no god : why compare me with the immortals ? I am your 
father , on whose account you endure many a sorrow that makes you groan , and suffer men�s violence . � 
So saying , he kissed his son , and shed the tear he had curbed till then . but 
Telemachus , unable to believe as yet that it was his 
father , addressed him again , saying : �You cannot be my 
father , 
Odysseus . Some god is deceiving me to make me suffer more . No mortal man could achieve all this himself , but only if a god came to him and willed him easily young or old . in truth , a moment ago you were an old man in rags , and now you are like one of those gods who rule the wide heavens . � / �Telemachus , � resourceful 
Odysseus replied , �you shouldn�t be so surprised that your 
father is here , and so astounded . No second 
Odysseus will ever show himself here , that you can be sure of . 
Here I am , before your eyes , back in my own country again after nigh on twenty years of wretched wandering . 
Athene the leader of armies has worked all this , making me appear as she wishes . 
She it is who has the power to make me look like a beggar one minute , a well-dressed youngster the next . It�s no problem for the gods who rule the wide heavens to glorify a man or to humble him . � / 
With this he sat down , and 
Telemachus flung his arms around him and wept , and the longing to express their emotion rose in both their hearts . 
They keened aloud , and their cries rose , louder and more frequent than those of birds of prey with curved talons , vultures or sea-eagles , whose nests have been robbed of their unfledged chicks by country folk . Tears streamed piteously from their eyes . 
And sunset would have found them still weeping , if 
Telemachus had not suddenly asked his 
father : �What ship brought you to Ithaca , dear 
father , and who did the sailors claim to be , since you can�t have arrived on foot ? � / noble , long-suffering 
Odysseus answered him : �My boy , rest assured I will tell you exactly how it was . Phaeacians brought me here , famous seafarers , who provide passage for any strangers who reach them . While I slept 
they 
carried me in their swift ship over the sea , then set me ashore on Ithaca , with the fine gifts 
they gave me , bronze and gold items , and woven fabrics . 
That wealth , by the grace of the gods , is hidden in a cave . 
Now I am here at Athene�s prompting to plan how we will kill our enemies . Run through the list of 
Suitors for me , and give me the count , so I know who 
they are and how many , and can judge with a clear mind whether we can handle them alone , or whether to seek for help . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered : �Father , I know of your great fame , as a mighty spearman and a great strategist , but I am amazed at what you are considering . 
Two men cannot fight so many brave opponents . 
There are not merely ten or twenty 
Suitors , but far more . let me number them for you now . Fifty-two picked men , with their six servants , from 
Dulichium . Twenty-four from 
Same , and twenty 
Achaean youths from 
Zacynthus . 
Then from Ithaca itself there are twelve noblemen , not counting the 
herald , 
Medon , and the divine minstrel , and the two men who carve their meat . if we come upon them all in the palace , your path of vengeance will prove a fierce and desperate one . No : think about anyone who might help , who would fight for us heart and soul . � / noble , long-suffering 
Odysseus replied : �Well : let me tell you : listen and pay attention : don�t you think 
Athene and 
Father 
Zeus will be help enough ? do I really need to think of other allies ? � 
And wise 
Telemachus answered : �High in the clouds sit those two helpers you speak of , and 
they are powerful indeed . Between them 
they rule mankind and the deathless gods . � / �They won�t hold back from a fierce fight , � 
said the noble , long-suffering 
Odysseus , �not when the issue between us and the 
Suitors is decided in my palace . Firstly however , go to the house at dawn , and mingle with the insolent 
Suitors . 
The swineherd will lead me to the 
city later , disguised as a wretched old beggar . if 
they mishandle me in the halls , steel your heart to their evil treatment . endure the sight of it , even if 
they haul me outside , and hurl things at me . 
Just try to dissuade them with soothing words , and tell them to stop their foolishness . They�ll not pay any attention , though , for their day of judgement is nigh . / Remember too , what I say next . 
When 
Athene , ripe in judgement , tells me , I will nod to you , and when you see my signal , take all the weapons in the hall , and put them away in the darkest corner of the high storeroom . if the 
Suitors miss them and question you , deceive them with placatory words , and say : �I�ve moved them out of the smoke from the fire , since 
they no longer look as 
they did when 
Odysseus left them behind and sailed for 
Troy , but are all grimy where the draught from the hearth has reached them . 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , has filled my heart with an even greater fear , that you might start a quarrel amongst yourselves , and wound each other , and so bring shame on the feast and your cause . Iron itself draws a man towards it . � / but leave a couple of swords and spears , and a pair of ox-hide shields , ready for us to run and seize them , while 
Pallas 
Athene and 
Zeus the 
Wise distract the 
Suitors . Remember too , what I say next . if you are the son of my blood in truth , let no one know 
Odysseus is back , not 
Laertes or the swineherd , nor anyone of the household , not even 
Penelope herself . 
We ourselves will judge the mood of the women , and sound out the men , and discover who honours us and fears us , and who gives nothing for us , and scorns your manhood . � / �Father , � �his splendid son replied , �you�ll know I�m not short of spirit , later , and you�ll see no lack of will on my part . but I ask you to re-consider : I don�t see that idea will benefit us . You�ll waste a deal of time sounding out men on the farms , while the insolent 
Suitors waste your wealth , at their ease , sparing nothing . 
Yes , find out which of the women are disloyal and which are honest , but forget about proving the men , we can do that later , if you have indeed been shown the will of aegis-bearing 
Zeus . � / 
So 
they debated , while the good ship that 
carried 
Telemachus and his friends from 
Pylos , made Ithaca . 
When its crew had navigated the deep harbour and drawn the black ship on shore , their squires took their equipment , and 
carried the fine gifts proudly to Clytius� house . 
At the same time 
they sent a 
herald to Odysseus� palace , to give 
Penelope news of Telemachus� arrival in the island and his order to sail round to the 
city , in case the noble queen grew anxious , and took to weeping . 
And so this 
herald and the noble swineherd met , as each , on the same errand , 
carried the news to Odysseus� wife . 
When 
they reached the royal palace the 
herald spoke in the presence of her handmaids , saying : �My queen , your dear son has just returned . � but 
Eumaeus 
approached 
Penelope and gave her the words of her loyal son , as he had been commanded . 
When he had relayed the whole message he left the hall and court and returned to his swine . / 
The 
Suitors were surprised and troubled , and 
they went out of the hall , past the high courtyard wall , and sat down in front of the gates . 
There 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , was first to speak : �My friends , 
Telemachus has accomplished something great in his arrogance , a journey we never thought to see him complete . 
Come , let us launch a black ship , and crew it with oarsmen , so we can send word to the others to return swiftly , � / 
His words were hardly out , when 
Amphinomus , turning round , saw a ship enter the harbour , men at the oars , and others furling sail . 
He laughed gaily , and addressed his friends : �There�s no need for a message , here 
they are ! 
Either a god told them , or 
they saw Telemachus� ship sail by and failed to catch her . � / 
They all rose at this , and went down to the shore . 
The crew quickly dragged the black ship on land , and their proud squires removed the equipment . 
Then the 
Suitors went in a crowd to the meeting place , and prevented anyone else attending , young or old . 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son spoke : �Alas , the gods have rescued that man from destruction . 
Day after day , men were at watch on the windy heights , and at sunset we headed offshore for the night , and waited out at sea for gleaming 
Dawn , hoping to catch and kill 
Telemachus : meanwhile some god has seen him home . Don�t let him slip through our hands : let us plan a sad death for him here , since I say while he lives our business will fail . 
He is wise and shrewd , and the people no longer support us . let us act before he calls on the 
Achaeans to assemble . I don�t believe he�ll wait a moment , but he�ll tell them all in his anger how we planned his utter ruin , then failed . We�ll get no praise for it when 
they hear of the evil we plotted : take care 
they don�t offer us harm , and drive us into exile in some foreign land . No : we must act first : take him in the fields outside the 
city , or on the road , then divide his wealth and possessions fairly between us , leaving his mother and whoever marries her with the palace . if this idea displeases you , and you decide to let him live and allow him to keep his ancestral wealth , then I suggest we disperse , and stop consuming his store of luxuries , and let each man woo her and try to win her from his own house : then she can marry the one that offers most , and is fated to be her husband . � / 
They were all silent when his speech ended . 
Then 
Amphinomus , the glorious son of prince 
Nisus , Aretias� son , addressed the gathering . 
He was the leader of the suitors from Dulichium�s wheat and grasslands , whose conversation pleased 
Penelope , because of his understanding heart . 
He spoke to the meeting , with good intent , saying : �Friends , I would not be one to decide on killing 
Telemachus : it is a fearful thing to murder a king�s son . No , let us first consult the will of the gods . if Zeus� oracle approves it , I will urge it on others , and destroy him myself . but if the gods advise against the action , I ask you to hold off . � / 
So 
said 
Amphinomus , and the idea pleased them . 
They rose at once and went to Odysseus� palace , and once across the threshold sat at their gleaming benches . / 
It was then a thought occurred to wise 
Penelope , to show herself to the 
Suitors in all their arrogance . 
She knew of the death threats to her son , since 
Medon the 
herald had overheard the plans and warned her . 
Now she led her handmaids to the hall , and drawing her shining veil across her face , placed herself by a door pillar of the splendid room , near to the 
Suitors . 
From there she aimed her rebuke at 
Antinous : �Filled with violence , 
Antinous , you plan your wickedness ! 
Yet 
they call you the most eloquent and intelligent man in Ithaca . 
That seems wrong to me . a madman , you are , plotting Telemachus� death , and trampling on suppliants 
Zeus vouches for ! It�s impious to plot against others . are you ignorant of that occasion when your 
father fled to this house , in terror of the mob ? 
They were wild with anger against him because he was in league with the 
Taphian pirates , harrying the 
Thesprotians , our allies . 
They meant to offer him violence , kill him and seize the whole of his vast and delightful property . 
Odysseus it was who restrained them , and turned them away despite the passion 
they were in . 
Now you waste his wealth without compensation , court his wife , and plan to murder his son . I , who am in great distress , beg you , and all the rest of you : desist . � / 
It was 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , who answered her : �Wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , let me reassure you , and don�t be anxious about these things . No man lives or shall live , no man shall ever be born , who dare lay hands on 
Telemachus , your son , while I exist to gaze on the light of day . I say it to you , and time will prove it so . 
That man�s black blood will coat my spear . for when I was a child 
Odysseus , sacker of cities , often set me on his knee , and fed me roast meat , and wetted my lips with wine . 
So , 
Telemachus is dearest of all men to me , and he need not fear death at the Suitors� hands : as for the gods , none can escape them . � / 
His words were designed to placate her , yet in his heart he plotted Telemachus� death . 
Then 
Penelope climbed the stairs to her shining chamber , and there she wept for 
Odysseus her dear husband , till bright-eyed 
Athene sealed her eyelids in sweet sleep . / 
That evening the worthy swineherd returned , while 
Odysseus and his son were busy making supper , having killed a yearling pig . 
Athene 
approached 
Odysseus , Laertes� son , once more and touched him with her wand , disguising him again as an old man , clothing him in foul rags , to prevent the swineherd recognising him on sight and running to loyal 
Penelope with the news , instead of keeping it secret . / 
Telemachus greeted him first : �Worthy 
Eumaeus , here you are ! 
What news from the 
city ? are those proud 
Suitors back from their ambush , or are 
they still out there lying in wait for me on my way home ? � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered then , saying : �I didn�t have time to enquire about it , in the 
city : my heart was urging me to hurry back here after delivering my message . but I met a 
herald , a speedy messenger sent by your friends , who broke the news to your mother . 
And one thing more I did see with my own eyes . 
From high above the 
city , on Hermes� 
Hill as I came back , I saw a swift ship making harbour , filled with men , glittering with shields and two-edged spears . I thought that might be them , but I�m not sure . � / 
At this , royal 
Telemachus glanced towards his 
father with a smile , while avoiding the swineherd�s eye . / 
When 
they had finished preparing the meal , 
they sat and ate , and were not disappointed by their shared supper . 
Then , having quenched hunger and thirst , 
they thought of their beds , and sought the gift of sleep . / back at the hut , 
Odysseus and the noble swineherd had lit a dawn fire , and were making breakfast , after sending the other herdsmen off with the swine . as 
Telemachus 
approached , the guard dogs failed to bark , instead 
they fawned around him . 
Odysseus , hearing the sound of footsteps and realising the dogs were silent , spoke to 
Eumaeus with winged words : �This must be some friend of yours , 
Eumaeus , or an old acquaintance . I hear footsteps , but the dogs are quiet , fawning round your visitor . � / 
He had barely finished speaking when his own brave son stood on the threshold . 
The swineherd leapt up in amazement , and the bowls he was using to mix the glowing wine fell from his hands . 
He ran to meet his master , and kissed his forehead , his sparkling eyes , and his hands , while the tears ran down his cheeks . 
The worthy swineherd clasped godlike 
Telemachus in his arms and kissed him endlessly as if he were back from the dead , as a loving 
father greets a son returned from a far-off land after a nine-year absence , a dear and only son for whom he has suffered much pain . 
And , in tears , he spoke to him with winged words : � / �Telemachus , sweet light of my eyes , you are here ! 
And I thought I would never see you more , after you sailed for 
Pylos . 
Come in , dear boy , and let me gladden my heart by gazing at you , home now from distant lands , and here , in my house . 
You seldom visit the herdsmen and the farm : you are always in town : I think you must enjoy watching that hateful crowd of 
Suitors . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �If you say so , old friend . I came here to see you , though , with my own eyes , and ask you whether my mother is still at home , or whether some man has married her leaving Odysseus� bed un-slept in , hung with foul cobwebs . � / �Truly , � the master swineherd replied , �she still suffers patiently in the palace , and while she weeps the nights and days pass by in sadness . � 
With this he took the bronze spear from 
Telemachus , who crossed the stone threshold . 
His 
father , 
Odysseus , rose at his approach to relinquish his chair , but 
Telemachus stopped him with a sign , and 
said : �Sit down , friend , and I�ll find a seat here elsewhere . Here�s a man who�ll find one for me . � 
With this , 
Odysseus sat down again , while the swineherd threw a fleece over a pile of brushwood so that Odysseus� steadfast son could be seated . 
Then the swineherd set out plates of roast meat from the previous day�s meal , and baskets piled with bread , and mixed honeyed wine in an ivy bowl , before sitting down opposite godlike 
Odysseus . / 
They stretched out their hands to the good food in front of them , and when 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , 
Telemachus asked the worthy swineherd : �Where does this stranger hail from , old friend ? 
What ship brought him to Ithaca and who did the sailors claim to be , since he couldn�t get here on foot ? � /

Laertes . tell my mother instead to send her maid to him , quickly and secretly : she can take the old man the news . � / 
He sent the swineherd on his way , then picked up his sandals and bound them to his feet , and headed for town . 
Athene , aware of Eumaeus� departure from the farm 
approached in the form of a tall , beautiful woman , skilled in fine handiwork . 
She stood by the entrance to the hut and was visible to 
Odysseus , but 
Telemachus failed to see or be aware of her : since the gods do not show themselves openly to all . 
The dogs , as well as 
Odysseus , saw her though , and slunk away whining , not barking , to the far side of the yard . 
She raised her eyebrows and seeing her signal 
Odysseus went out past the wall of the court and stood there , facing her . 
Then 
Athene spoke to him : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , tell your son who you are no longer hide it , and when you have planned how to kill the 
Suitors , go on towards town . I will not be far from you , I am eager for the fight . � / 
Saying this , 
Athene touched him with her golden wand . 
She clothed him in a clean tunic and cloak , increased his stature , and restored his youthful complexion . 
His colour returned , his cheeks filled out , and his beard darkened . 
Then she departed , leaving 
Odysseus to return to the hut . 
There his son was amazed , and troubled , dropping his gaze , fearing he was in the presence of a god . 
He spoke with winged words : �Stranger , you seem different now than you were a moment ago . 
Your clothes are new , and your complexion has changed . 
Surely you are one of the gods that rule the wide heavens ? Be gracious , and spare us , and let us offer you fitting sacrifice , and fine gifts wrought with gold . � / noble long-suffering 
Odysseus replied : �I am no god : why compare me with the immortals ? I am your 
father , on whose account you endure many a sorrow that makes you groan , and suffer men�s violence . � 
So saying , he kissed his son , and shed the tear he had curbed till then . but 
Telemachus , unable to believe as yet that it was his 
father , addressed him again , saying : �You cannot be my 
father , 
Odysseus . Some god is deceiving me to make me suffer more . No mortal man could achieve all this himself , but only if a god came to him and willed him easily young or old . in truth , a moment ago you were an old man in rags , and now you are like one of those gods who rule the wide heavens . � / �Telemachus , � resourceful 
Odysseus replied , �you shouldn�t be so surprised that your 
father is here , and so astounded . No second 
Odysseus will ever show himself here , that you can be sure of . 
Here I am , before your eyes , back in my own country again after nigh on twenty years of wretched wandering . 
Athene the leader of armies has worked all this , making me appear as she wishes . 
She it is who has the power to make me look like a beggar one minute , a well-dressed youngster the next . It�s no problem for the gods who rule the wide heavens to glorify a man or to humble him . � / 
With this he sat down , and 
Telemachus flung his arms around him and wept , and the longing to express their emotion rose in both their hearts . 
They keened aloud , and their cries rose , louder and more frequent than those of birds of prey with curved talons , vultures or sea-eagles , whose nests have been robbed of their unfledged chicks by country folk . Tears streamed piteously from their eyes . 
And sunset would have found them still weeping , if 
Telemachus had not suddenly asked his 
father : �What ship brought you to Ithaca , dear 
father , and who did the sailors claim to be , since you can�t have arrived on foot ? � / noble , long-suffering 
Odysseus answered him : �My boy , rest assured I will tell you exactly how it was . Phaeacians brought me here , famous seafarers , who provide passage for any strangers who reach them . While I slept 
they 
carried me in their swift ship over the sea , then set me ashore on Ithaca , with the fine gifts 
they gave me , bronze and gold items , and woven fabrics . 
That wealth , by the grace of the gods , is hidden in a cave . 
Now I am here at Athene�s prompting to plan how we will kill our enemies . Run through the list of 
Suitors for me , and give me the count , so I know who 
they are and how many , and can judge with a clear mind whether we can handle them alone , or whether to seek for help . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered : �Father , I know of your great fame , as a mighty spearman and a great strategist , but I am amazed at what you are considering . 
Two men cannot fight so many brave opponents . 
There are not merely ten or twenty 
Suitors , but far more . let me number them for you now . Fifty-two picked men , with their six servants , from 
Dulichium . Twenty-four from 
Same , and twenty 
Achaean youths from 
Zacynthus . 
Then from Ithaca itself there are twelve noblemen , not counting the 
herald , 
Medon , and the divine minstrel , and the two men who carve their meat . if we come upon them all in the palace , your path of vengeance will prove a fierce and desperate one . No : think about anyone who might help , who would fight for us heart and soul . � / noble , long-suffering 
Odysseus replied : �Well : let me tell you : listen and pay attention : don�t you think 
Athene and 
Father 
Zeus will be help enough ? do I really need to think of other allies ? � 
And wise 
Telemachus answered : �High in the clouds sit those two helpers you speak of , and 
they are powerful indeed . Between them 
they rule mankind and the deathless gods . � / �They won�t hold back from a fierce fight , � 
said the noble , long-suffering 
Odysseus , �not when the issue between us and the 
Suitors is decided in my palace . Firstly however , go to the house at dawn , and mingle with the insolent 
Suitors . 
The swineherd will lead me to the 
city later , disguised as a wretched old beggar . if 
they mishandle me in the halls , steel your heart to their evil treatment . endure the sight of it , even if 
they haul me outside , and hurl things at me . 
Just try to dissuade them with soothing words , and tell them to stop their foolishness . They�ll not pay any attention , though , for their day of judgement is nigh . / Remember too , what I say next . 
When 
Athene , ripe in judgement , tells me , I will nod to you , and when you see my signal , take all the weapons in the hall , and put them away in the darkest corner of the high storeroom . if the 
Suitors miss them and question you , deceive them with placatory words , and say : �I�ve moved them out of the smoke from the fire , since 
they no longer look as 
they did when 
Odysseus left them behind and sailed for 
Troy , but are all grimy where the draught from the hearth has reached them . 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , has filled my heart with an even greater fear , that you might start a quarrel amongst yourselves , and wound each other , and so bring shame on the feast and your cause . Iron itself draws a man towards it . � / but leave a couple of swords and spears , and a pair of ox-hide shields , ready for us to run and seize them , while 
Pallas 
Athene and 
Zeus the 
Wise distract the 
Suitors . Remember too , what I say next . if you are the son of my blood in truth , let no one know 
Odysseus is back , not 
Laertes or the swineherd , nor anyone of the household , not even 
Penelope herself . 
We ourselves will judge the mood of the women , and sound out the men , and discover who honours us and fears us , and who gives nothing for us , and scorns your manhood . � / �Father , � �his splendid son replied , �you�ll know I�m not short of spirit , later , and you�ll see no lack of will on my part . but I ask you to re-consider : I don�t see that idea will benefit us . You�ll waste a deal of time sounding out men on the farms , while the insolent 
Suitors waste your wealth , at their ease , sparing nothing . 
Yes , find out which of the women are disloyal and which are honest , but forget about proving the men , we can do that later , if you have indeed been shown the will of aegis-bearing 
Zeus . � / 
So 
they debated , while the good ship that 
carried 
Telemachus and his friends from 
Pylos , made Ithaca . 
When its crew had navigated the deep harbour and drawn the black ship on shore , their squires took their equipment , and 
carried the fine gifts proudly to Clytius� house . 
At the same time 
they sent a 
herald to Odysseus� palace , to give 
Penelope news of Telemachus� arrival in the island and his order to sail round to the 
city , in case the noble queen grew anxious , and took to weeping . 
And so this 
herald and the noble swineherd met , as each , on the same errand , 
carried the news to Odysseus� wife . 
When 
they reached the royal palace the 
herald spoke in the presence of her handmaids , saying : �My queen , your dear son has just returned . � but 
Eumaeus 
approached 
Penelope and gave her the words of her loyal son , as he had been commanded . 
When he had relayed the whole message he left the hall and court and returned to his swine . / 
The 
Suitors were surprised and troubled , and 
they went out of the hall , past the high courtyard wall , and sat down in front of the gates . 
There 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , was first to speak : �My friends , 
Telemachus has accomplished something great in his arrogance , a journey we never thought to see him complete . 
Come , let us launch a black ship , and crew it with oarsmen , so we can send word to the others to return swiftly , � / 
His words were hardly out , when 
Amphinomus , turning round , saw a ship enter the harbour , men at the oars , and others furling sail . 
He laughed gaily , and addressed his friends : �There�s no need for a message , here 
they are ! 
Either a god told them , or 
they saw Telemachus� ship sail by and failed to catch her . � / 
They all rose at this , and went down to the shore . 
The crew quickly dragged the black ship on land , and their proud squires removed the equipment . 
Then the 
Suitors went in a crowd to the meeting place , and prevented anyone else attending , young or old . 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son spoke : �Alas , the gods have rescued that man from destruction . 
Day after day , men were at watch on the windy heights , and at sunset we headed offshore for the night , and waited out at sea for gleaming 
Dawn , hoping to catch and kill 
Telemachus : meanwhile some god has seen him home . Don�t let him slip through our hands : let us plan a sad death for him here , since I say while he lives our business will fail . 
He is wise and shrewd , and the people no longer support us . let us act before he calls on the 
Achaeans to assemble . I don�t believe he�ll wait a moment , but he�ll tell them all in his anger how we planned his utter ruin , then failed . We�ll get no praise for it when 
they hear of the evil we plotted : take care 
they don�t offer us harm , and drive us into exile in some foreign land . No : we must act first : take him in the fields outside the 
city , or on the road , then divide his wealth and possessions fairly between us , leaving his mother and whoever marries her with the palace . if this idea displeases you , and you decide to let him live and allow him to keep his ancestral wealth , then I suggest we disperse , and stop consuming his store of luxuries , and let each man woo her and try to win her from his own house : then she can marry the one that offers most , and is fated to be her husband . � / 
They were all silent when his speech ended . 
Then 
Amphinomus , the glorious son of prince 
Nisus , Aretias� son , addressed the gathering . 
He was the leader of the suitors from Dulichium�s wheat and grasslands , whose conversation pleased 
Penelope , because of his understanding heart . 
He spoke to the meeting , with good intent , saying : �Friends , I would not be one to decide on killing 
Telemachus : it is a fearful thing to murder a king�s son . No , let us first consult the will of the gods . if Zeus� oracle approves it , I will urge it on others , and destroy him myself . but if the gods advise against the action , I ask you to hold off . � / 
So 
said 
Amphinomus , and the idea pleased them . 
They rose at once and went to Odysseus� palace , and once across the threshold sat at their gleaming benches . / 
It was then a thought occurred to wise 
Penelope , to show herself to the 
Suitors in all their arrogance . 
She knew of the death threats to her son , since 
Medon the 
herald had overheard the plans and warned her . 
Now she led her handmaids to the hall , and drawing her shining veil across her face , placed herself by a door pillar of the splendid room , near to the 
Suitors . 
From there she aimed her rebuke at 
Antinous : �Filled with violence , 
Antinous , you plan your wickedness ! 
Yet 
they call you the most eloquent and intelligent man in Ithaca . 
That seems wrong to me . a madman , you are , plotting Telemachus� death , and trampling on suppliants 
Zeus vouches for ! It�s impious to plot against others . are you ignorant of that occasion when your 
father fled to this house , in terror of the mob ? 
They were wild with anger against him because he was in league with the 
Taphian pirates , harrying the 
Thesprotians , our allies . 
They meant to offer him violence , kill him and seize the whole of his vast and delightful property . 
Odysseus it was who restrained them , and turned them away despite the passion 
they were in . 
Now you waste his wealth without compensation , court his wife , and plan to murder his son . I , who am in great distress , beg you , and all the rest of you : desist . � / 
It was 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , who answered her : �Wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , let me reassure you , and don�t be anxious about these things . No man lives or shall live , no man shall ever be born , who dare lay hands on 
Telemachus , your son , while I exist to gaze on the light of day . I say it to you , and time will prove it so . 
That man�s black blood will coat my spear . for when I was a child 
Odysseus , sacker of cities , often set me on his knee , and fed me roast meat , and wetted my lips with wine . 
So , 
Telemachus is dearest of all men to me , and he need not fear death at the Suitors� hands : as for the gods , none can escape them . � / 
His words were designed to placate her , yet in his heart he plotted Telemachus� death . 
Then 
Penelope climbed the stairs to her shining chamber , and there she wept for 
Odysseus her dear husband , till bright-eyed 
Athene sealed her eyelids in sweet sleep . / 
That evening the worthy swineherd returned , while 
Odysseus and his son were busy making supper , having killed a yearling pig . 
Athene 
approached 
Odysseus , Laertes� son , once more and touched him with her wand , disguising him again as an old man , clothing him in foul rags , to prevent the swineherd recognising him on sight and running to loyal 
Penelope with the news , instead of keeping it secret . / 
Telemachus greeted him first : �Worthy 
Eumaeus , here you are ! 
What news from the 
city ? are those proud 
Suitors back from their ambush , or are 
they still out there lying in wait for me on my way home ? � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered then , saying : �I didn�t have time to enquire about it , in the 
city : my heart was urging me to hurry back here after delivering my message . but I met a 
herald , a speedy messenger sent by your friends , who broke the news to your mother . 
And one thing more I did see with my own eyes . 
From high above the 
city , on Hermes� 
Hill as I came back , I saw a swift ship making harbour , filled with men , glittering with shields and two-edged spears . I thought that might be them , but I�m not sure . � / 
At this , royal 
Telemachus glanced towards his 
father with a smile , while avoiding the swineherd�s eye . / 
When 
they had finished preparing the meal , 
they sat and ate , and were not disappointed by their shared supper . 
Then , having quenched hunger and thirst , 
they thought of their beds , and sought the gift of sleep . /
