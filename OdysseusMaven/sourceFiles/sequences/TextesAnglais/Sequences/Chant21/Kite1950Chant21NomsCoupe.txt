
Now , the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , prompted wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , to confront the 
Suitors in Odysseus� palace with his bow and the grey iron axes , as a challenge and a means to their destruction . 
Penelope climbed the high stair to her room , and with a firm hand , took up a bronze key , finely-shaped with an ivory handle . She made her way with her women to the distant storeroom , where her husband�s treasure lay , gold and bronze and hammered iron . 
There lay the curved bow , and quiver full of fatal arrows , given him when he visited 
Lacedaemon , by 
godlike 
Iphitus , Eurytus� son . / 
They 
had met in 
Messene , at the house of wise Ortilochus . 
Odysseus was there to collect a public debt , because 
Messenians 
had stolen three hundred sheep and their shepherds too from Ithaca , loading them aboard their oared ships . 
Odysseus 
had been sent by his father and other elders to resolve the matter , though he was still quite young . 
Iphitus was there in search of a dozen brood mares he 
had lost , along with the sturdy little mules they were suckling . but his search caused his death , when he came upon 
Heracles , Zeus� lion-hearted son , well-versed in mighty labours . 
Ruthless 
Heracles killed him , though he was a guest in his house . 
Careless of the gods� anger and the sanctity of the dinner-table , he killed him there and then , and hid the heavy-hoofed mares in his own stables . / but back when 
Iphitus was searching for them , he 
had met 
Odysseus , and given him the bow that mighty 
Eurytus carried of old , and that , dying in his palace , he 
had left to his son . 
And 
Odysseus 
had given 
Iphitus in return a sharp sword and a fine spear as a token of the start of a loving friendship . but before they could meet again at table , Zeus� son 
had killed 
godlike 
Iphitus , Eurytus� son , the giver of the bow that noble 
Odysseus 
had never taken with him aboard his black ship to war , leaving it behind in his palace as a memento of a 
good friend , to use only at home . / 
Now 
Penelope , that lovely woman , reached the storeroom and set foot on the oaken sill , once skilfully planed and trued to the line by some carpenter of old , who also set the doorposts in it , and hung the gleaming doors . 
Quickly she unhooked the thong , slid in the key and with a sure touch shot back the bolt . 
With a groan like a bull bellowing in a grassy meadow , the polished doors flew open at the touch of the key . 
Then she mounted to the high platform loaded with chests of fragrant clothes . 
Here , reaching up , she lifted the bow , in the gleaming case , from its peg . 
Then she sat 
down with the case on her knees , and weeping aloud drew out her husband�s bow . 
Yet once her tears and sighs were done , she went to the hall and the crowd of noble 
Suitors , carrying the curved bow and the quiver full of fatal arrows . 
And the maids followed with a chest full of bronze and iron won by her man . 
When the lovely woman reached the 
Suitors , she stood by a pillar of the great hall , with a shining veil in front of her face , and a loyal maid stood on either side . 
Then she issued her challenge . / �Noble 
Suitors , listen to me . 
You have battened on this house , with its master long gone , eating and drinking endlessly , and you could find no better excuse to offer than the desire to win me as a wife . 
Well come now , my 
Suitors , your prize stands here before you , clear to see . 
Godlike Odysseus� mighty bow is the test . Whoever makes the best attempt at stringing the bow and shooting an arrow through the rings of a dozen axes , with that man I will go , and leave this house that saw me a bride , this lovely and luxurious house , that I will always remember in my dreams . � / 
With this she ordered 
Eumaeus the master-swineherd to set out the bow and the axes with their handle-rings of grey iron for the 
Suitors . 
Eumaeus was in tears as he laid them 
down , and the cowherd wept too , at the sight of his master�s bow . 
Antinous turned on them in anger : �Stupid yokels , living in the past ! 
Your tears , you wretches , lower your mistress� spirits , as though her heart wasn�t already troubled by her husband�s loss . 
Sit and eat in silence , or go outside and snivel , and leave the bow here to test us , her 
Suitors : I doubt this gleaming bow will be easy to string , since I once saw 
Odysseus , and there�s no man here to equal him . 
Yes , I remember him , though I was but a child . � / 
Such were his words , but he nursed the hope in his heart that he himself would string the bow and shoot an arrow through the iron rings . 
Yet in truth he was to be the first to feel the blow of an arrow from peerless 
Odysseus whom he was now abusing in the palace , while 
urging on his friends to do the same . / 
Then royal 
Telemachus 
intervened : �Zeus must have addled my wits , indeed ! 
My dear mother , in her wisdom , says she will take another husband and leave this house , and I laugh like a happy idiot ! 
Come , my lords , since your prize is here , a lady who has no equal in all 
Achaea , not in 
Pylos , 
Argos , or 
Mycenae , nor in Ithaca itself , nor on the dark mainland . 
You know that yourselves , what need have I to sing my mother�s praises ? No excuses now : let�s have no delay in stringing the bow , and then we�ll see . I might even try the bow myself , later . if I can string it and shoot an arrow through the iron rings , I shan�t be so upset by my dear mother�s departure for another house , seeing I myself will be a man capable of winning fine prizes like my father . � / 
Saying this , 
Telemachus threw off his purple cloak , and springing up removed the sharp sword slung from his shoulder . 
Then he set all the axes in a long trench , in a straight line , stamping the earth in around them . 
The onlookers were amazed that never having seen them before he arranged them so correctly . 
Then he took up his stand on the threshold and tried the bow . Three times it quivered in his hands as he made a fierce effort to string it , and three times he 
had to relax his grip , though he 
had hoped deep 
down to succeed and shoot an arrow through the iron handle-rings . 
Now exerting all his power he might have strung it at the fourth attempt 
had 
Odysseus not shaken his head , and checked his eagerness . / �Alas� royal 
Telemachus exclaimed , �it seems I shall always be a coward and a weakling . but perhaps I am still too young , and haven�t the strength yet to defend myself against whoever picks quarrels for no reason . 
You then , who have more strength than I , try the bow , and decide the contest . � / 
With this , he placed the bow on the ground , leaning it against the gleaming panels of the door , and the feathered arrow against the door-handle , and then resumed his seat . 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , called out : �Come forward , all of you 
Suitors , one by one , from left to right , beginning from where the wine-steward sits . � 
They welcomed his words , and the first to rise was 
Leodes , Oenops� son , their seer , who always sat by the huge mixing bowl in the depths of the hall : he alone despised the Suitors� acts of wantonness , and they filled him with indignation . 
Now he was first to take up the feathered arrow and the bow , stride to the threshold , and try to string it . but he failed , his smooth and delicate hands quickly drained of strength . He spoke to the 
Suitors , saying : �My Friends , I cannot do it : let someone else try . This bow will break the heart and spirit of many a man here . 
Still , it is better to die trying , than live on without winning the prize that brings us here each day , in endless expectation . 
Many must hope and long to wed 
Penelope , Odysseus� wife , but when they have tried the bow , and failed , let them go woo some other 
Achaean woman in her lovely robe , and try and win her with their gifts . 
And let 
Penelope wed the man who offers her most , and is destined to be her husband . � / 
With this , he set the bow aside , leaning it against the gleaming panels of the door , and the feathered arrow against the door-handle , and then resumed his seat . but 
Antinous criticised him , saying : �Leodes , what dark and monstrous words have crossed your tongue ! I�m angered by your suggestion that �this bow will break the heart and spirit of many a warrior here� , merely because you failed to string it . 
Your dear mother didn�t bear you for drawing a mighty bow , and shooting arrows , perhaps , but others of the noble 
Suitors will soon succeed . � / 
Then he called to the goatherd , 
Melanthius : �Quick , light a fire in the hall , 
Melanthius , and put a large fleece-covered chair beside it , and bring a big piece of tallow from the stores , so that we youngsters can heat the bow and grease it , before we try it and settle the contest . � 
Melanthius , swiftly obeyed . He revived the glowing fire , put the large fleece-covered chair beside it , and brought a big piece of tallow from the stores . 
The youths then warmed the bow and tried to string it , but those who tried were too weak to succeed . / 
Antinous and 
godlike 
Eurymachus , however , the leaders of the 
Suitors , and the most capable , continued the contest . 
Meanwhile noble 
Odysseus� cowherd and swineherd slipped out of the hall together , and Odysseus followed them . 
When they were beyond the courtyard gates he 
sounded them out carefully : / �Cowherd , swineherd , Can I share something with you or should I keep it to myself ? 
My heart tells me to speak . if 
Odysseus suddenly returned , brought by some god , would you be the men to fight for him ? 
Would you be for the 
Suitors or 
Odysseus ? 
Say what your heart and spirit tell you . � / �Father 
Zeus , � the cowherd prayed , �may that come true ! 
May the hero return , with a god�s guidance ! 
Then you would see the strength I can still show in my hands . � 
And 
Eumaeus also prayed , to all the gods , that wise 
Odysseus might come home . / once 
Odysseus was sure , he opened his mind to them , saying : �Well , I am home . 
Here I stand before you , I myself , back in my own country in the twentieth year after many painful trials . I know that of all my servants you both welcome my return , but I�ve not heard a single one of the others praying I might reach home . I�ll tell you truly what I intend for you . if a god brings the noble 
Suitors 
down , I�ll find you each a wife , give you goods , and build you a house near mine : and I�ll always regard you as friends and brothers of 
Telemachus . 
Now , so you can be certain in your hearts that it is I , let me show you a sign you�ll know , the scar from the wound the white-tusked boar gave me , when I hunted 
Parnassus with Autolycus� sons . � / 
So saying , he drew his rags apart to show the long scar . 
When the two 
had examined it carefully , they clasped their arms about wise 
Odysseus� neck , and weeping kissed his head and shoulders in loving recognition . Odysseus likewise kissed their heads and hands . 
And the twilight would have seen them still weeping if 
Odysseus 
had not restrained them : �Stop wailing now , in case someone comes from the house and sees us , and tells those inside . Let�s go back in , now , one after the other , not together . 
Follow me , and here�s the signal we will act on . 
The others , the noble 
Suitors , will refuse to allow me to handle the bow and quiver , but as you carry the bow round the hall , 
Eumaeus , set it in my hands , and tell the women to shut their hall doors tight . 
Say that if any of them hear men shouting or groaning in here , they are not to rush out , but to stay there and silently carry out their tasks . 
And 
good 
Philoetius , I charge you with barring the gate of the courtyard , and lashing it tight . � / 
With this , he entered the royal palace , and resumed his seat . 
And the two servants followed . / 
The bow 
had reached 
Eurymachus , who was turning it in his hands before the fire to warm it . but despite that he failed to string it , and groaning inwardly he said , in anger : �Oh , I�m not just bitter about this myself , but for all of you , too . It�s not that I�m bothered about the marriage , though it grieves me . 
There are plenty of other women in 
Achaea , in Ithaca�s isle , and in other places . No , it�s more that our strength falls so short of 
godlike Odysseus� that we can�t even string his bow . It�s a disgrace that posterity will hear of . � / �No , 
Eurymachus , � 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , replied , �that�s not so , and do you know why ? 
Today is the feast of 
Apollo , throughout the island , his holy day . 
Should we be bending bows ? set it aside , softly . as for the axes , why not leave them there ? No one will steal them : not from a house owned by 
Odysseus , Laertes� son . 
Come , let the steward pour wine for libations , and put the bow 
down . in the morning tell the goatherd , 
Melanthius , to bring us the best she-goats in the flock , so we can lay thigh-pieces on Apollo�s altar , the famous archer , then try the bow , and decide the contest . � / 
They all agreed with 
Antinous . 
So , while the squires sprinkled water over their hands , pages filled the mixing bowls and served them all , first pouring a few drops of wine for libation into each man�s cup . 
When they 
had made their libations and quenched their thirst , resourceful 
Odysseus spoke with subtle intent : �Suitors of the glorious 
Queen , hear me , so I might express what is in my mind . I aim my plea primarily at 
Eurymachus , and 
godlike 
Antinous , who made such a 
good suggestion , to forget the bow for today , and leave the issue to the gods . 
Come morning the god will grant victory to whoever he wishes . 
So , lend me the polished bow , and I can see what strength is in my hands , and if I still possess the power I used to have in limbs once supple , or whether poor nourishment and endless wandering has reduced it . � / 
The 
Suitors were greatly angered by his words : all afraid he might string the gleaming bow . 
Antinous addressed him with scorn : �Wretched beggar , you�re out of your mind . Isn�t it enough for you we allow you to dine in peace in our noble company , letting you share in what�s on the table , privileged to listen to our talk , unlike other beggars and strangers . 
The wine , the honeyed wine , has addled your brain as it does others who gulp it 
down without restraint . 
It was wine that maddened 
Eurytion , the famous 
Centaur , in brave Peirithous� palace , when he visited the 
Lapithae . Crazed with drink he caused uproar in Peirithous� own house . 
The outraged hosts leapt to their feet , and dragged him through the gate then cut off his nose and ears with the cruel bronze , leaving him to wander off , bearing the burden of tragic error caused by his foolish urge . 
So began the feud between the 
Centaurs and men , but he was the first to meet disaster , drunk with the wine . I promise you the same , if you string the bow . You�ll find no help from anyone here . We�ll pack you off in a black ship to 
King 
Echetus , the maimer of men , and you�ll not escape with your life . 
So , have done , and drink your wine , and don�t try and compete with younger men . � / but wise 
Penelope 
intervened : �It is neither right nor just , 
Antinous , to deny his due to a man who came to Telemachus� house as a guest . do you really think that if the stranger , trusting in the strength of his hands , strings Odysseus� bow , he will take me home as his wife ? He could never harbour such a hope . 
So let none of you sit at this feast in trepidation : that would be wrong . � / 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , answered her : �Icarius� daughter , wise 
Penelope , we 
had no thought of his taking you home , that would certainly be wrong , but we shudder at the thought of idle gossip , of some wretch among the 
Achaeans saying : �Those are weaklings that woo the wife of a peerless man . 
They can�t even string his gleaming bow , though a wandering beggar did so easily , and shot an arrow through the axes . � 
So they would say , and shame us . � / �Eurymachus� said wise 
Penelope , �no one thinks well , in any case , of men like you who ruin and dishonour a King�s house , so why worry about further shame ? 
The stranger is tall and well-built , and says he comes of 
good stock . 
Well then , hand him the gleaming bow , and let us see . 
Hear what I say , and I�ll surely do this too : if 
Apollo brings him glory and he strings the bow , I�ll dress him in a fine new cloak and tunic , and give him a sharp spear to keep off dogs and men , and a double-edged sword , and sandals for his feet , and help him travel wherever his heart and mind dictate . � / 
It was wise 
Telemachus who spoke to her then : �Mother , none of the 
Achaeans � those who rule in rocky Ithaca or in the islands seaward of the horse pastures of 
Elis � have more right than I to give or refuse the bow to whoever I wish . none of them can challenge my will even if I choose to give the bow to the stranger , here and now , to take away with him . 
So go to your quarters now , and attend to your own duties at loom and spindle , and order your maids about their tasks : let men worry about such things , and I especially , since I hold the authority in this house . � / 
Seized with wonder she retired to her own room , taking her son�s wise words to heart . 
Up to her high chamber she went , accompanied by her maids , and there she wept for 
Odysseus , her dear husband , till bright-eyed 
Athene 
veiled her eyelids with sweet sleep . / 
Meanwhile the worthy swineherd 
had picked up the curved bow and was walking off with it , when the 
Suitors cried out in protest . One proud youth called out : �Where do you think you�re going with that , you wretch , your mind must be addled ? if 
Apollo and the rest of the gracious gods are 
good to us , the hounds you�ve bred yourself will finish you off , out there alone , far from men , among the swine . � / 
At this , 
Eumaeus dropped the bow he was carrying , on the spot , terrified by the uproar in the hall . but 
Telemachus shouted harshly at him from the other side : �Stick to the bow , old man � you�ll be full of regret if you listen to them all � or , young as I am , I�ll shower you with stones , and chase you through the fields . 
My strength is greater than yours . I only wish the power of my hands was greater than the 
Suitors� in my hall , then I�d soon send a few of them off in a way they wouldn�t enjoy , the trouble makers . � / on hearing this , the Suitors laughed out loud at 
Telemachus , and so blunted the edge of their anger , while the swineherd carried the bow through the hall , and reaching wise 
Odysseus , set it in his hands . 
Then 
Eumaeus spoke softly to the nurse 
Eurycleia , saying : �Wise 
Eurycleia , 
Telemachus orders you to shut the hall doors tight , and if any of the women hear men shouting or groaning in here , they are not to rush out , but to stay where they are and silently carry out their tasks . � / 
So he spoke , and without a word she went and locked the doors of the great hall . 
At the same time , 
Philoetius slipped out quietly to bar the gates of the courtyard . He lashed them to , with a ship�s cable twined from papyrus reed that was lying beneath the portico , then slipped back inside , and resumed his seat , keeping his eyes fixed on 
Odysseus . He meanwhile was handling the bow , turning it this way and that , fearing the pieces of horn bound to the wood might have become worm-eaten while he was away . 
The 
Suitors 
glanced at each other , and one commented : �This fellow must be an expert , or a cunning dealer in bows . or if he hasn�t got bows like this stored away at home , the wretched beggar must be setting out to make one : he studies it so carefully . � / 
Another arrogant youth replied : �I�d guess he�d have as much luck at that as he will at trying to string this bow . � / 
So they chattered , but once wily 
Odysseus 
had flexed the great bow and checked it all over , he strung it easily , as a man skilled in song and the lyre stretches a new string onto its leather tuning strap , fixing the twisted sheep-gut at either end . 
Then grasping the bow in his right hand , he plucked the string that sang sweetly to his touch with the sound of a swallow�s note . / 
The 
Suitors were mortified , and their faces were drained of colour , while 
Zeus 
sounded a peal of thunder as a sign . noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was pleased at this omen from the son of devious 
Cronos , and he picked up the feathered arrow that lay alone on the table next to him , while the others the 
Achaeans were destined to feel were still packed in their hollow quiver . He set it against the bridge of the bow , drew back the notched arrow with the string , and still seated in his chair let fly with a sure aim . 
The bronze-weighted shaft flew through the handle hole of every axe from first to last without fail , sped clean through and out at the end . 
Then he turned to 
Telemachus saying : �The guest in your hall has not disgraced you . I have not missed the target , nor did it take me long to string the bow . 
My strength is undiminished , not lessened as the Suitors� taunts implied . 
Well now it is time for the 
Achaeans to eat , while there is light , and afterwards we shall have different entertainment , with song and lyre , fitting for a celebration . � / as he spoke he gave the signal , and 
Telemachus , the 
godlike hero�s steadfast son , slung on his sharp-edged sword , grasped his spear , and stood beside his father , armed with the glittering bronze . / 
Now , the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , prompted wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , to confront the 
Suitors in Odysseus� palace with his bow and the grey iron axes , as a challenge and a means to their destruction . 
Penelope climbed the high stair to her room , and with a firm hand , took up a bronze key , finely-shaped with an ivory handle . She made her way with her women to the distant storeroom , where her husband�s treasure lay , gold and bronze and hammered iron . 
There lay the curved bow , and quiver full of fatal arrows , given him when he visited 
Lacedaemon , by 
godlike 
Iphitus , Eurytus� son . / 
They 
had met in 
Messene , at the house of wise Ortilochus . 
Odysseus was there to collect a public debt , because 
Messenians 
had stolen three hundred sheep and their shepherds too from Ithaca , loading them aboard their oared ships . 
Odysseus 
had been sent by his father and other elders to resolve the matter , though he was still quite young . 
Iphitus was there in search of a dozen brood mares he 
had lost , along with the sturdy little mules they were suckling . but his search caused his death , when he came upon 
Heracles , Zeus� lion-hearted son , well-versed in mighty labours . 
Ruthless 
Heracles killed him , though he was a guest in his house . 
Careless of the gods� anger and the sanctity of the dinner-table , he killed him there and then , and hid the heavy-hoofed mares in his own stables . / but back when 
Iphitus was searching for them , he

Odysseus , and given him the bow that mighty 
Eurytus carried of old , and that , dying in his palace , he 
had left to his son . 
And 
Odysseus 
had given 
Iphitus in return a sharp sword and a fine spear as a token of the start of a loving friendship . but before they could meet again at table , Zeus� son 
had killed 
godlike 
Iphitus , Eurytus� son , the giver of the bow that noble 
Odysseus 
had never taken with him aboard his black ship to war , leaving it behind in his palace as a memento of a 
good friend , to use only at home . / 
Now 
Penelope , that lovely woman , reached the storeroom and set foot on the oaken sill , once skilfully planed and trued to the line by some carpenter of old , who also set the doorposts in it , and hung the gleaming doors . 
Quickly she unhooked the thong , slid in the key and with a sure touch shot back the bolt . 
With a groan like a bull bellowing in a grassy meadow , the polished doors flew open at the touch of the key . 
Then she mounted to the high platform loaded with chests of fragrant clothes . 
Here , reaching up , she lifted the bow , in the gleaming case , from its peg . 
Then she sat 
down with the case on her knees , and weeping aloud drew out her husband�s bow . 
Yet once her tears and sighs were done , she went to the hall and the crowd of noble

Eumaeus the master-swineherd to set out the bow and the axes with their handle-rings of grey iron for the

Eumaeus was in tears as he laid them 
down , and the cowherd wept too , at the sight of his master�s bow .

Eurymachus , however , the leaders of the 
Suitors , and the most capable , continued the contest . 
Meanwhile noble 
Odysseus� cowherd and swineherd slipped out of the hall together , and Odysseus followed them . 
When they were beyond the courtyard gates he 
sounded them out carefully : / �Cowherd , swineherd , Can I share something with you or should I keep it to myself ? 
My heart tells me to speak . if 
Odysseus suddenly returned , brought by some god , would you be the men to fight for him ? 
Would you be for the 
Suitors or 
Odysseus ? 
Say what your heart and spirit tell you . � / �Father 
Zeus , � the cowherd prayed , �may that come true ! 
May the hero return , with a god�s guidance ! 
Then you would see the strength I can still show in my hands . � 
And 
Eumaeus also prayed , to all the gods , that wise 
Odysseus might come home . / once 
Odysseus was sure , he opened his mind to them , saying : �Well , I am home . 
Here I stand before you , I myself , back in my own country in the twentieth year after many painful trials . I know that of all my servants you both welcome my return , but I�ve not heard a single one of the others praying I might reach home . I�ll tell you truly what I intend for you . if a god brings the noble 
Suitors 
down , I�ll find you each a wife , give you goods , and build you a house near mine : and I�ll always regard you as friends and brothers of 
Telemachus . 
Now , so you can be certain in your hearts that it is I , let me show you a sign you�ll know , the scar from the wound the white-tusked boar gave me , when I hunted 
Parnassus with Autolycus� sons . � / 
So saying , he drew his rags apart to show the long scar . 
When the two 
had examined it carefully , they clasped their arms about wise 
Odysseus� neck , and weeping kissed his head and shoulders in loving recognition . Odysseus likewise kissed their heads and hands . 
And the twilight would have seen them still weeping if 
Odysseus 
had not restrained them : �Stop wailing now , in case someone comes from the house and sees us , and tells those inside . Let�s go back in , now , one after the other , not together . 
Follow me , and here�s the signal we will act on . 
The others , the noble 
Suitors , will refuse to allow me to handle the bow and quiver , but as you carry the bow round the hall , 
Eumaeus , set it in my hands , and tell the women to shut their hall doors tight . 
Say that if any of them hear men shouting or groaning in here , they are not to rush out , but to stay there and silently carry out their tasks . 
And 
good 
Philoetius , I charge you with barring the gate of the courtyard , and lashing it tight . � / 
With this , he entered the royal palace , and resumed his seat . 
And the two servants followed . / 
The bow 
had reached 
Eurymachus , who was turning it in his hands before the fire to warm it . but despite that he failed to string it , and groaning inwardly he said , in anger : �Oh , I�m not just bitter about this myself , but for all of you , too . It�s not that I�m bothered about the marriage , though it grieves me . 
There are plenty of other women in 
Achaea , in Ithaca�s isle , and in other places . No , it�s more that our strength falls so short of 
godlike Odysseus� that we can�t even string his bow . It�s a disgrace that posterity will hear of . � / �No , 
Eurymachus , � 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , replied , �that�s not so , and do you know why ? 
Today is the feast of 
Apollo , throughout the island , his holy day . 
Should we be bending bows ? set it aside , softly . as for the axes , why not leave them there ? No one will steal them : not from a house owned by 
Odysseus , Laertes� son . 
Come , let the steward pour wine for libations , and put the bow 
down . in the morning tell the goatherd , 
Melanthius , to bring us the best she-goats in the flock , so we can lay thigh-pieces on Apollo�s altar , the famous archer , then try the bow , and decide the contest . � / 
They all agreed with 
Antinous . 
So , while the squires sprinkled water over their hands , pages filled the mixing bowls and served them all , first pouring a few drops of wine for libation into each man�s cup . 
When they 
had made their libations and quenched their thirst , resourceful 
Odysseus spoke with subtle intent : �Suitors of the glorious 
Queen , hear me , so I might express what is in my mind . I aim my plea primarily at 
Eurymachus , and 
godlike 
Antinous , who made such a 
good suggestion , to forget the bow for today , and leave the issue to the gods . 
Come morning the god will grant victory to whoever he wishes . 
So , lend me the polished bow , and I can see what strength is in my hands , and if I still possess the power I used to have in limbs once supple , or whether poor nourishment and endless wandering has reduced it . � / 
The 
Suitors were greatly angered by his words : all afraid he might string the gleaming bow . 
Antinous addressed him with scorn : �Wretched beggar , you�re out of your mind . Isn�t it enough for you we allow you to dine in peace in our noble company , letting you share in what�s on the table , privileged to listen to our talk , unlike other beggars and strangers . 
The wine , the honeyed wine , has addled your brain as it does others who gulp it 
down without restraint . 
It was wine that maddened 
Eurytion , the famous 
Centaur , in brave Peirithous� palace , when he visited the 
Lapithae . Crazed with drink he caused uproar in Peirithous� own house . 
The outraged hosts leapt to their feet , and dragged him through the gate then cut off his nose and ears with the cruel bronze , leaving him to wander off , bearing the burden of tragic error caused by his foolish urge . 
So began the feud between the 
Centaurs and men , but he was the first to meet disaster , drunk with the wine . I promise you the same , if you string the bow . You�ll find no help from anyone here . We�ll pack you off in a black ship to 
King 
Echetus , the maimer of men , and you�ll not escape with your life . 
So , have done , and drink your wine , and don�t try and compete with younger men . � / but wise 
Penelope 
intervened : �It is neither right nor just , 
Antinous , to deny his due to a man who came to Telemachus� house as a guest . do you really think that if the stranger , trusting in the strength of his hands , strings Odysseus� bow , he will take me home as his wife ? He could never harbour such a hope . 
So let none of you sit at this feast in trepidation : that would be wrong . � / 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , answered her : �Icarius� daughter , wise 
Penelope , we 
had no thought of his taking you home , that would certainly be wrong , but we shudder at the thought of idle gossip , of some wretch among the 
Achaeans saying : �Those are weaklings that woo the wife of a peerless man . 
They can�t even string his gleaming bow , though a wandering beggar did so easily , and shot an arrow through the axes . � 
So they would say , and shame us . � / �Eurymachus� said wise 
Penelope , �no one thinks well , in any case , of men like you who ruin and dishonour a King�s house , so why worry about further shame ? 
The stranger is tall and well-built , and says he comes of 
good stock . 
Well then , hand him the gleaming bow , and let us see . 
Hear what I say , and I�ll surely do this too : if 
Apollo brings him glory and he strings the bow , I�ll dress him in a fine new cloak and tunic , and give him a sharp spear to keep off dogs and men , and a double-edged sword , and sandals for his feet , and help him travel wherever his heart and mind dictate . � / 
It was wise 
Telemachus who spoke to her then : �Mother , none of the 
Achaeans � those who rule in rocky Ithaca or in the islands seaward of the horse pastures of 
Elis � have more right than I to give or refuse the bow to whoever I wish . none of them can challenge my will even if I choose to give the bow to the stranger , here and now , to take away with him . 
So go to your quarters now , and attend to your own duties at loom and spindle , and order your maids about their tasks : let men worry about such things , and I especially , since I hold the authority in this house . � / 
Seized with wonder she retired to her own room , taking her son�s wise words to heart . 
Up to her high chamber she went , accompanied by her maids , and there she wept for 
Odysseus , her dear husband , till bright-eyed 
Athene 
veiled her eyelids with sweet sleep . / 
Meanwhile the worthy swineherd 
had picked up the curved bow and was walking off with it , when the 
Suitors cried out in protest . One proud youth called out : �Where do you think you�re going with that , you wretch , your mind must be addled ? if 
Apollo and the rest of the gracious gods are 
good to us , the hounds you�ve bred yourself will finish you off , out there alone , far from men , among the swine . � / 
At this , 
Eumaeus dropped the bow he was carrying , on the spot , terrified by the uproar in the hall . but 
Telemachus shouted harshly at him from the other side : �Stick to the bow , old man � you�ll be full of regret if you listen to them all � or , young as I am , I�ll shower you with stones , and chase you through the fields . 
My strength is greater than yours . I only wish the power of my hands was greater than the 
Suitors� in my hall , then I�d soon send a few of them off in a way they wouldn�t enjoy , the trouble makers . � / on hearing this , the Suitors laughed out loud at 
Telemachus , and so blunted the edge of their anger , while the swineherd carried the bow through the hall , and reaching wise 
Odysseus , set it in his hands . 
Then 
Eumaeus spoke softly to the nurse 
Eurycleia , saying : �Wise 
Eurycleia , 
Telemachus orders you to shut the hall doors tight , and if any of the women hear men shouting or groaning in here , they are not to rush out , but to stay where they are and silently carry out their tasks . � / 
So he spoke , and without a word she went and locked the doors of the great hall . 
At the same time , 
Philoetius slipped out quietly to bar the gates of the courtyard . He lashed them to , with a ship�s cable twined from papyrus reed that was lying beneath the portico , then slipped back inside , and resumed his seat , keeping his eyes fixed on 
Odysseus . He meanwhile was handling the bow , turning it this way and that , fearing the pieces of horn bound to the wood might have become worm-eaten while he was away . 
The 
Suitors 
glanced at each other , and one commented : �This fellow must be an expert , or a cunning dealer in bows . or if he hasn�t got bows like this stored away at home , the wretched beggar must be setting out to make one : he studies it so carefully . � / 
Another arrogant youth replied : �I�d guess he�d have as much luck at that as he will at trying to string this bow . � / 
So they chattered , but once wily 
Odysseus 
had flexed the great bow and checked it all over , he strung it easily , as a man skilled in song and the lyre stretches a new string onto its leather tuning strap , fixing the twisted sheep-gut at either end . 
Then grasping the bow in his right hand , he plucked the string that sang sweetly to his touch with the sound of a swallow�s note . / 
The 
Suitors were mortified , and their faces were drained of colour , while 
Zeus 
sounded a peal of thunder as a sign . noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was pleased at this omen from the son of devious 
Cronos , and he picked up the feathered arrow that lay alone on the table next to him , while the others the 
Achaeans were destined to feel were still packed in their hollow quiver . He set it against the bridge of the bow , drew back the notched arrow with the string , and still seated in his chair let fly with a sure aim . 
The bronze-weighted shaft flew through the handle hole of every axe from first to last without fail , sped clean through and out at the end . 
Then he turned to 
Telemachus saying : �The guest in your hall has not disgraced you . I have not missed the target , nor did it take me long to string the bow . 
My strength is undiminished , not lessened as the Suitors� taunts implied . 
Well now it is time for the 
Achaeans to eat , while there is light , and afterwards we shall have different entertainment , with song and lyre , fitting for a celebration . � / as he spoke he gave the signal , and 
Telemachus , the 
godlike hero�s steadfast son , slung on his sharp-edged sword , grasped his spear , and stood beside his father , armed with the glittering bronze . /
