
And now the sun sprang from the eastern waters into the brazen firmament , bringing light to the deathless ones , and to mortal men on earth the giver of grain , and 
they reached 
Pylos , Neleus� well-ordered 
city . 
Here on the shore the people were sacrificing black bulls to the dark-tressed 
Earth-Shaker , 
Poseidon . Nine companies of five hundred men sat there , each with nine bulls prepared for the sacrifice . 
They were tasting the innards , and burning the thigh-pieces to the god , as the travellers headed straight for shore , brailed up and furled their sail , moored the ship and disembarked . 
Athene 
led the way , and 
Telemachus followed , but first bright-eyed 
Athene , the goddess , spoke to him : / �Telemachus , you have no need for diffidence here . 
You have sailed the sea for this , to search for news of your father , what earth covers him , and what fate he met with . Go straight to 
Nestor , now , to the tamer of horses : let us find what wisdom he keeps in his heart . 
Beg him yourself to speak the honest truth . 
He is truly wise and will not utter a lie . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �Mentor , how can I go and greet him ? I am inexperienced in the subtleties of speech : more than that , a young man is shy of questioning his elders . � / 
Then the bright-eyed goddess , 
Athene , answered him : �Telemachus , part your own mind will devise , and heaven will prompt the rest . 
You were not born or reared , I think , without divine favour . � / 
With that , 
Pallas 
Athene quickly 
led the way , and he followed in the goddess� footsteps . 
So 
they reached the gathering , the companies of the men of 
Pylos . 
There sat 
Nestor with his sons , and round them his people preparing the feast , skewering meat on spits , and roasting it . but when 
they saw the strangers , 
they crowded round them , clasped their hands in welcome , begging them to be seated . Nestor�s son , 
Peisistratus , was first to approach and took them both by the hand , and made them sit on soft fleeces spread on the sand , beside his father , and brother , 
Thrasymedes , so 
they could feast . 
Having done so , he served them inner portions , poured wine in a golden cup , and drinking her health , spoke to 
Pallas 
Athene , the aegis-bearing daughter of 
Zeus : / �Stranger , pray to the lord 
Poseidon whose feast you have chanced on here . 
And when you have poured libations and 
prayed , as is right , pass your friend the cup of honeyed wine so he may pour . I expect he too prays to the deathless ones : since all men need the gods . but as he is the younger , and of my own age , I will first give the golden cup to you . � / 
He placed the cup of sweet wine in her hand , as he spoke , and 
Pallas 
Athene was delighted by his wisdom and politeness , in giving the golden beaker first to her : and at once she made a heartfelt prayer to the lord 
Poseidon : / �Hear me , 
Poseidon , 
Earth-Bearer : do not begrudge fulfilment of what we ask , and answer our prayer . 
Firstly , grant fame to 
Nestor and his sons . 
Then , graciously repay all the men of 
Pylos for this sumptuous offering . 
Then , grant that 
Telemachus and I accomplish the task that brought us here in our swift black ship , and let us reach home again . � / 
So she 
prayed and fulfilled it all herself . 
Next , she 
handed 
Telemachus the fine two-handled cup , and Odysseus� steadfast son repeated her prayer . After roasting the outer flesh and removing it from the spits , 
they divided the portions and ate of the rich feast . 
And when 
they had sated their appetite for food and drink , the horseman , 
Gerenian 
Nestor , spoke : / �Now that our visitors have eaten well , it is fitting to question the strangers and ask them who 
they are . Friends , who are you ? 
Where do you sail from over the sea-roads ? are you on business , or do you roam at random , like pirates who chance their lives to bring evil to others ? � / 
Then wise 
Telemachus plucked up courage to answer , inspired by 
Athene , so as to ask about his lost father , and retain the respect of his men : / �Nestor , son of 
Neleus , great glory of the 
Achaeans , you ask where we come from , and I will tell you . We are from Ithaca , below 
Mount 
Neion : and what I speak of is private business . I come in hopes of hearing some rumour of my father , steadfast 
Odysseus , who , 
they say , fought at your side , and sacked the 
city of 
Troy . for we have heard of every man who met a sad end , among those who fought the 
Trojans , but as for 
Odysseus , the son of 
Cronos allows even his death to go unreported , and no one can say for certain where he died , whether conquered by enemies on land , or at sea among Amphitrite�s waves . 
So I come to clasp your knees , and ask you to speak if you can , and will , of his sad death , a death you may have seen yourself , or heard tell of from other travellers : for he was a man whom his mother bore to sorrow beyond all men . 
And do not speak soothing words out of concern for me , or pity , but tell me , in truth , what news you have . if ever my father , good 
Odysseus , promised you word or action and fulfilled it , on that field of 
Troy where 
Achaeans suffered , I beg you , remember it now : tell me the whole truth . / 
The horseman , 
Nestor of 
Gerenia , answered him : �Friend , you bring to mind the pain we suffered there , we sons of 
Achaea , great in courage : all that suffering of ours aboard ship , sailing the misty deep after plunder wherever 
Achilles 
led , and all our battles around 
King Priam�s mighty 
city , where the best of us died . 
There lies ajax , beloved of ares : there lie 
Achilles and Patroclus , equal to the gods in counsel . 
There lies my own dear son , 
Antilochus , strong and faultless , swift of foot , and great in battle . 
Who among mortal men could tell all the evils we suffered ? if you remained here five or six years , and heard of the troubles the noble 
Achaeans endured there you would be weary before the end , and go home . for nine years we were busy planning their destruction with all known stratagems , but 
Zeus , the son of 
Cronos , made it hard to achieve . No man there dared to compete in counsel with 
Odysseus , your father if you are truly his son , since noble 
Odysseus was supreme in all known stratagems . I wonder as I gaze at you : your speech is exactly his , and one would hardly expect a younger man to speak so . Throughout those years , 
Odysseus and I never spoke on opposite sides , in council or assembly , but with one mind advised the 
Argives , wisely and shrewdly , how to achieve success . but when we had sacked Priam�s high citadel , and sailed away , and a god had scattered the fleet , then 
Zeus planned a grievous journey for the 
Argives , because some had behaved incautiously and unjustly . 
Many came to a dark fate , through the fierce anger of the bright-eyed goddess , daughter of a mighty father , stirring a quarrel between Atreus� two sons . 
Hastily and informally , 
they called the 
Achaeans to an assembly at sunset , and because of it the sons of 
Achaea arrived sodden with wine . 
Then 
they spoke , and explained why 
they had gathered the host . 
Menelaus suggested 
they made their return over the wide sea the priority , but this displeased 
Agamemnon , who wished to delay them there , and to offer holy sacrifice to appease Athene�s deadly anger , not knowing foolishly that she would not listen , since the will of the everlasting gods cannot be swiftly altered . 
So the two of them stood there , exchanging harsh words , until the bronze-greaved 
Achaeans , divided in opinion , broke up in almighty uproar . � / �That night we rested , each side nursing harsh thoughts against the other , for 
Zeus was preparing a deadly blow . in the morning half of us launched our ships on the glittering sea , stowing away our goods , loading the captive women in their low-necked robes . 
Half of the army held back , supporting 
Agamemnon , Atreus�s son , the shepherd of the flock , while the rest of us embarked , then gathered way . / 
The ships sailed swiftly , for a god had smoothed the sea that nurtures monsters . 
Making 
Tenedos , and desirous of reaching home , we sacrificed to the immortals , but 
Zeus , that recalcitrant deity , did not wish us to return yet , and stirred another bitter quarrel . At that point one squadron , under the wise and cunning lord 
Odysseus , who once more favoured 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son , swung their curved prows about , and turned back . I , with a massed fleet of ships following me , sailed on , knowing the god intended trouble . 
Diomedes , Tydeus� son , beloved of ares , likewise drove his crews onward , and behind us sailed yellow-haired 
Menelaus . 
He caught us at 
Lesbos as we argued whether to head out west from rugged 
Chios , towards the island of 
Psyria , keeping it to larboard , or to sail south , landward of 
Chios , past Mimas� windy promontories . We asked the god for a sign , and the god made it clear we 
should cut across open sea , westward to 
Euboea , to escape from trouble most quickly . a fierce wind blew , and the ships ran swiftly over the teeming deep , and that night put in to 
Geraestus . 
There we laid many a bull�s thigh on Poseidon�s altar , to give thanks for our crossing . on the fourth day from then 
Diomedes , Tydeus� son , tamer of horses , and all his company , beached their fine ships at 
Argos , but I sailed on for 
Pylos , and the wind never dropped from the moment the god first made it blow . / 
So , dear boy , I reached home without news of the others , knowing nothing of which 
Achaeans were saved , and which were lost . but you have a right to all the news I have heard as I sit here in my palace , and I will keep nothing back . 
They say that the myrmidons returned safely , those fierce spearmen that 
Achilles once 
led , and 
Philoctetes returned too , Poias� brilliant son . 
And 
Idomeneus brought those of his troops who escaped the war back to 
Crete , and none were lost at sea . as for that son of 
Atreus , 
Agamemnon , you will have heard , far off though you were , of his homecoming , and of how 
Aegisthus plotted his sad end . 
Yet he too paid a terrible price , showing how good it is that a man leaves a son behind to take vengeance on his murderer . for 
Orestes took vengeance on his father�s killer , crafty 
Aegisthus , for all his treachery . 
You too , friend , a fine tall man as I see , take courage , so that many a man of generations yet to be born shall praise you . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �Nestor , son of 
Neleus , great glory of the 
Achaeans , his son indeed took vengeance , and the 
Achaeans will noise his fame abroad , so that generations yet to be born will hear . 
Would that the gods would grant me such power , that I might exact a like revenge on the 
Suitors for their heavy sins , and the wilful wrongs 
they perpetrate against me . but the gods weave no such joys for me , or my father : I must simply endure . � / 
Nestor , the 
Gerenian charioteer , replied : �Friend , your words remind me : 
they say a crowd of 
Suitors courting your mother commit evils in your palace against you . tell me , do you submit to this willingly , or is it that the people of Ithaca have turned against you , spurred on by the voice of some god ? 
Who knows whether 
Odysseus may not return one day , alone or with an 
Achaean host , and take vengeance on them for their violence ? if only bright-eyed 
Athene would choose to love you , as she once cherished noble 
Odysseus on the 
Trojan fields where we 
Achaeans suffered . I have never seen a god show love so openly , as 
Pallas 
Athene showed to him , standing there by his side . if she delighted in loving you like that , and cared deeply for you , then the whole crowd of them could forget about marriage . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered him : �Venerable lord , I doubt that what you say could ever be . 
You speak of something too wonderful . 
There is no hope of it , even if the gods so willed it . � / 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , spoke to him : �Telemachus , what are you saying ? a god who wills it can easily bring a man safely home , from however far away . I would rather endure great suffering , myself , before I reached home , than be 
killed at my own hearth later , as 
Agamemnon was 
killed by the cunning of 
Aegisthus , and his own wife . but still the gods themselves cannot keep death , the common fate , from a man 
they love , when the deadly hand of merciless destiny fells him . � / �Mentor , � 
said wise 
Telemachus , �let us be silent now about these grievous things . 
He can no longer return : on the contrary the deathless ones have brought death�s dark fate to him . but there is another question I would ask of 
Nestor , since he above all understands wisdom and judgement : men say he has been king for three lives of men , and he seems to me one of the immortals . 
Nestor , son of 
Neleus , tell me truly how that great king , 
Agamemnon , son of 
Atreus , was 
killed ? 
Where was 
Menelaus , then ? 
How did crafty 
Aegisthus plan to kill the king , a man far stronger than himself ? 
Was 
Menelaus not home in 
Achaean 
Argos , but roaming abroad , that 
Aegisthus had the courage to commit the murder ? / 
Nestor , the 
Gerenian charioteer , replied : �I will tell you truly , my child , as you ask . 
You can guess yourself how it would have ended if yellow-haired 
Menelaus , Atreus� son , returning from 
Troy , had found 
Aegisthus alive in the palace . none would even have heaped a burial mound for him : dogs and birds would have torn his flesh on the plain , far outside the 
city , and no woman of 
Achaea would have mourned him , because of his monstrous crime . We played our part at 
Troy completing our many tasks , but he idled in that haven of 
Argos , the horse-pasture , seducing Agamemnon�s wife with his chatter . At first the noble 
Clytaemnestra , in her wisdom , shunned the base act : and besides she had a minstrel with her to whom 
Agamemnon had given strict orders to guard his wife , when he left for 
Troy . but when the gods at last destined that 
Agamemnon 
should be destroyed , 
Aegisthus took the minstrel to a desert isle , and left him there as a gift for the birds of prey : and as he wished , and she wished , 
led her to his own house . 
And he burned great heaps of thigh-pieces on the gods� holy altar , and hung up rich offerings of fine fabrics , and gold , when he had accomplished that dreadful murder , which in his heart he had never thought could succeed . / for 
Agamemnon and I had sailed , in friendship , together from 
Troy : but when we came to sacred 
Sunium , the cape south of 
Athens , Phoebus 
Apollo 
killed Menelaus� helmsman with a painless arrow , while his hands gripped the tiller of the speeding craft . 
And 
Phrontis , son of 
Onetor , had been first among men at steering a ship when the storm winds blew . 
So , though 
Menelaus was anxious to sail on , he waited to bury his friend , and offered the funeral rites . 
Then when he got away in his hollow ships , over the wine-dark sea , and ran downwind to Malea�s steep headland , 
Zeus of the far-reaching voice destined a troubled course for him , and engulfed him in a roaring gale , swelling the waves to the height of mountains . 
Then he split the fleet apart , carrying some ships to 
Crete and the 
Cydonian lands on the river 
Iardanus . 
There is a sheer cliff , falling to the sea , in the misty waves on the borders of 
Gortyn , where the southwest winds drive great breakers against the western headland near 
Phaestus , and a slender reef stems their flow . 
Reaching it , the waves smashed the ships against the rocks , and the men barely escaped destruction . / 
However , wind and wave had carried five of the blue-prowed vessels to Egypt . 
So 
Menelaus cruised there with his ships among men of foreign tongue , gathering goods and gold . 
Meanwhile 
Aegisthus plotted his tragic action at home , murdering 
Agamemnon , and then controlling his people . 
He ruled gold-rich 
Mycenae for seven years , but the eighth brought 
Orestes his doom from 
Athens , come to slay his father�s murderer , crafty 
Aegisthus , in revenge . 
And when he had slain him , he called the 
Argives to a funeral feast , over the bodies of his vile mother and cowardly 
Aegisthus : and on that very day 
Menelaus of the loud war cry returned , bringing rich treasure , all that his ships could carry . � / �So do not wander far from home , yourself , my friend , leaving your wealth behind , and insolent men in your palace , for fear 
they share out your riches and consume them , making your journey worthless . I urge you to visit 
Menelaus , since he returned later from those distant parts , that region from which one might fear never to return , being driven by storms into the wide sea that birds cross only twice a year , so vast it is , and dangerous . Go with your ship and crew , or if you prefer the land here is a chariot and team , and my sons are at your service , that can guide you to lovely 
Lacedaemon , where yellow-haired 
Menelaus lives . 
Ask for the truth from his lips , yourself . 
He , being wise , will not deceive you . � / as 
Nestor 
ceased , the sun dipped and darkness fell . 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene spoke to them : �Venerable lord , you have 
said truly . but come , cut up the tongues , and mix the wine , so that we may pour the libations to 
Poseidon and the other gods , then think of sleep . 
It is time , since the light fades into darkness , and we 
should not sit too long at the gods� feast , but go to our beds . � / 
So the daughter of 
Zeus spoke , and 
they paid attention to her words . squires poured water over their hands , while young men filled the brimming bowls , and after sprinkling a few drops into the wine-cups , as a libation , 
handed them round . 
Then 
they placed the tongues in the fire , and rising to their feet poured libations on them . but when 
they had offered the wine and drunk deep themselves , 
Athene and godlike 
Telemachus were ready to return to their hollow ship . 
Nestor , though detained them , saying : / �May 
Zeus and the other immortals forbid this , that you 
should leave me and go to your swift ship , as if I were a beggar in rags , who lacks soft cloaks and blankets in plenty on which his guests might sleep . I have both , and the steadfast son of 
Odysseus shall not sleep on his ship�s deck while I am alive , or sons survive me here , to welcome strangers who reach my door . � Bright-eyed 
Athene 
said : �You have spoken well , my lord , and 
Telemachus 
should stay : that will be best . but while he follows you , and shall sleep in your palace , I will go to the black ship to explain , and to reassure our crew . for I am the oldest among them : 
they are youths , friends of like age to the great-hearted 
Telemachus 
they follow . I will sleep there , by the black ship�s hull , tonight . 
And in the morning I will head for the great-hearted 
Cauconians , who owe me a heavy and long-standing debt . 
Then , since this young man is your guest , send him on his way , by chariot , with your son beside him , and let his horses be the strongest and swiftest you have . � / 
So the goddess spoke , bright-eyed 
Athene , and flew off in the form of a sea eagle : and all were amazed at the sight . 
The 
old man marvelled when he saw , and clasping Telemachus� hand he 
said : �Friend , you will prove neither a fool nor a coward since the gods go with you to guide you , and you so young . for this was none other of the gods that live on Olympus but the lady of 
Lake 
Tritonis , the glorious virgin daughter of 
Zeus , who granted your noble father honour too among 
Argives . 
Queen , be gracious to me , and let them speak well of me and my sons , and the wife I revere : and in return I will offer a wide-browed yearling heifer , not yet broken to the plough . I will gild her horns and sacrifice her to you . � / 
He 
prayed , and 
Pallas 
Athene heard . 
Then the horseman , 
Gerenian 
Nestor , with his sons , and sons-in-law , 
led the way to his lovely home . 
And , reaching the king�s fine palace , 
they seated themselves in rows on the chairs and stools : and the 
old man mixed them a sweet bowl of wine , from a sealed jar the housekeeper opened , now , in its eleventh year . 
Mixing a bowl of the vintage , the 
old man poured libations , and 
prayed intently to 
Athene , the daughter of 
Zeus , who wears the aegis . / After pouring libations , and drinking their fill , 
they each went off to rest , while 
Nestor , the horseman of 
Gerenia , arranged for the steadfast son of divine 
Odysseus to sleep on a wooden bed in the echoing portico , with 
Peisistratus , of the ash spear , leader of men , and the only unmarried son left in the palace , beside him . but 
Nestor himself slept in the innermost room of the tall building , and with him his lady wife for love and comfort . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
Nestor the 
Gerenian horseman rose from his bed : went out , and seated himself on the smooth stone bench , white and gleaming as though with oil , that stood in front of the high doors . 
Neleus had once sat there , as wise as a god in counsel , but he had long since been felled by fate and gone down to Hades� halls . 
Now 
Gerenian 
Nestor sat there in his turn , a 
Warden of the 
Achaeans , with the sceptre in his hand . His sons gathered round him , as 
they came from their rooms , 
Echephron and 
Stratius , 
Perseus , 
Aretus , and godlike 
Thrasymedes . 
The warrior 
Peisistratus made a sixth , and 
they seated godlike 
Telemachus beside him . 
Nestor , the 
Gerenian horseman , spoke first : / 
My dear sons , be quick to do my will , so that I can propitiate 
Athene above all , who came openly in person to the god�s rich feast . let one of you go to the meadow for a heifer , and let the cowherd drive her swiftly : let another go to great-hearted Telemachus� black ship and bring his friends , all but two : and let a third call 
Laerces the goldsmith here to tip the heifer�s horns with gold . 
The rest of you stay here , and tell the women to prepare a feast in the palace , and seats , and firewood , and fresh water . � / 
They set about their tasks , as ordered . 
The heifer arrived from the meadow , and great-hearted Telemachus� crew from the fine swift ship : the smith brought bronze tools in his hands , anvil , hammer and well-wrought tongs , the instruments of his gold-working craft : and 
Athene too arrived to witness the sacrifice . 
Then 
old 
Nestor the charioteer gave the smith gold to gild the heifer�s horns , so the goddess would delight in the offering . 
Then 
Stratius and noble 
Echephron 
led the heifer by the horns , and 
Aretus came from the palace bringing water in a flowered bowl for them to wash with , and a basket of barley meal , in his other hand . 
Thrasymedes , stalwart in fighting , stood there , gripping a sharp axe to strike the heifer , and 
Perseus held the dish for the blood . 
Then 
old 
Nestor the charioteer opened the rites by washing his hands and scattering barley grains , and 
prayed intently to 
Athene , cutting hair from the victim�s head as a first offering , and throwing it into the flames . / 
When 
they had 
prayed , and scattered the barley grains , 
Thrasymedes , Nestor�s high-spirited son , approached and struck the blow . 
The axe severed the sinews of the heifer�s neck , and crippled her strength , and the women raised the ritual cry , all the daughters , and daughters-in-law , and Nestor�s honoured wife , 
Eurydice , Clymenus� eldest daughter . 
Then the men raised the heifer�s head from the trampled earth , and held it while 
Peisistratus , that leader of men , slit its throat . 
When the black blood had flowed , and life had left its body , 
they dismembered the carcass , cut out the thigh pieces accordingly , wrapped them in layers of fat , and covered them with raw meat . 
Then the 
old king burned them on the fire , and poured glowing wine over them , while the young men waited beside him , five-pronged forks in hand . 
When the thigh pieces were burned , then 
they tasted the inner parts , carving the rest , skewering and roasting it , holding the sharpened skewers in their hands . / 
Then lovely 
Polycaste , Nestor�s youngest daughter , bathed 
Telemachus . 
And when she had bathed him and rubbed him with oil , and dressed him in tunic and fine cloak , he emerged from the baths like an immortal , and seated himself by 
Nestor , the people�s shepherd . / 
When 
they had roasted the outer flesh and stripped it from the skewers , 
they sat down to eat , with squires in attendance to fill their wine-cups . After 
they had sated themselves with food and drink , 
Nestor , the 
Gerenian horseman was first to speak : �Now , my sons , harness horses with flowing manes to Telemachus� chariot , so he may start his journey . � / 
He spoke , and 
they eagerly heard and obeyed : rapidly harnessing swift horses to the chariot . 
The housekeeper stocked it with bread and wine , and delicacies , such as kings eat whom 
Zeus favours . 
Then 
Telemachus mounted the fine chariot , and 
Peisistratus , leader of men , Nestor�s son , climbed up beside him and grasped the reins in his hands . 
He flicked the team with his whip to start them , and the willing pair took to the plain , and left the high 
city of 
Pylos behind them . 
And all day long 
they strained at the yoke across their necks . / 
Now the sun dipped and the roads grew dark . 
And 
they came to 
Pherae , to Diocles� house , Ortilochus� son whom 
Alpheius bore . 
There 
they passed the night , and he welcomed them , as strangers 
should be welcomed . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
they harnessed the horses , mounted the ornate chariot , and drove past the echoing portico out of the gate . 
Then 
Peistratus flicked the team with his whip to start them , and the willing pair flew onwards . 
So 
they came to plains of wheat , and pushed on towards journey�s end , drawn by their fleeting horses . 
And the sun dipped down and all the roads grew dark . / 
And now the sun sprang from the eastern waters into the brazen firmament , bringing light to the deathless ones , and to mortal men on earth the giver of grain , and 
they reached 
Pylos , Neleus� well-ordered 
city . 
Here on the shore the people were sacrificing black bulls to the dark-tressed 
Earth-Shaker , 
Poseidon . Nine companies of five hundred men sat there , each with nine bulls prepared for the sacrifice . 
They were tasting the innards , and burning the thigh-pieces to the god , as the travellers headed straight for shore , brailed up and furled their sail , moored the ship and disembarked . 
Athene 
led the way , and 
Telemachus followed , but first bright-eyed 
Athene , the goddess , spoke to him : / �Telemachus , you have no need for diffidence here . 
You have sailed the sea for this , to search for news of your father , what earth covers him , and what fate he met with . Go straight to 
Nestor , now , to the tamer of horses : let us find what wisdom he keeps in his heart . 
Beg him yourself to speak the honest truth . 
He is truly wise and will not utter a lie . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �Mentor , how can I go and greet him ? I am inexperienced in the subtleties of speech : more than that , a young man is shy of questioning his elders . � / 
Then the bright-eyed goddess , 
Athene , answered him : �Telemachus , part your own mind will devise , and heaven will prompt the rest . 
You were not born or reared , I think , without divine favour . � / 
With that , 
Pallas 
Athene quickly 
led the way , and he followed in the goddess� footsteps . 
So 
they reached the gathering , the companies of the men of 
Pylos . 
There sat 
Nestor with his sons , and round them his people preparing the feast , skewering meat on spits , and roasting it . but when 
they saw the strangers , 
they crowded round them , clasped their hands in welcome , begging them to be seated . Nestor�s son , 
Peisistratus , was first to approach and took them both by the hand , and made them sit on soft fleeces spread on the sand , beside his father , and brother , 
Thrasymedes , so 
they could feast . 
Having done so , he served them inner portions , poured wine in a golden cup , and drinking her health , spoke to 
Pallas 
Athene , the aegis-bearing daughter of 
Zeus : / �Stranger , pray to the lord 
Poseidon whose feast you have chanced on here . 
And when you have poured libations and 
prayed , as is right , pass your friend the cup of honeyed wine so he may pour . I expect he too prays to the deathless ones : since all men need the gods . but as he is the younger , and of my own age , I will first give the golden cup to you . � / 
He placed the cup of sweet wine in her hand , as he spoke , and 
Pallas 
Athene was delighted by his wisdom and politeness , in giving the golden beaker first to her : and at once she made a heartfelt prayer to the lord 
Poseidon : / �Hear me , 
Poseidon , 
Earth-Bearer : do not begrudge fulfilment of what we ask , and answer our prayer . 
Firstly , grant fame to 
Nestor and his sons . 
Then , graciously repay all the men of 
Pylos for this sumptuous offering . 
Then , grant that 
Telemachus and I accomplish the task that brought us here in our swift black ship , and let us reach home again . � / 
So she 
prayed and fulfilled it all herself . 
Next , she 
handed 
Telemachus the fine two-handled cup , and Odysseus� steadfast son repeated her prayer . After roasting the outer flesh and removing it from the spits , 
they divided the portions and ate of the rich feast . 
And when 
they had sated their appetite for food and drink , the horseman , 
Gerenian 
Nestor , spoke : / �Now that our visitors have eaten well , it is fitting to question the strangers and ask them who 
they are . Friends , who are you ? 
Where do you sail from over the sea-roads ? are you on business , or do you roam at random , like pirates who chance their lives to bring evil to others ? � / 
Then wise 
Telemachus plucked up courage to answer , inspired by 
Athene , so as to ask about his lost father , and retain the respect of his men : / �Nestor , son of 
Neleus , great glory of the 
Achaeans , you ask where we come from , and I will tell you . We are from Ithaca , below 
Mount 
Neion : and what I speak of is private business . I come in hopes of hearing some rumour of my father , steadfast 
Odysseus , who , 
they say , fought at your side , and sacked the 
city of 
Troy . for we have heard of every man who met a sad end , among those who fought the 
Trojans , but as for 
Odysseus , the son of 
Cronos allows even his death to go unreported , and no one can say for certain where he died , whether conquered by enemies on land , or at sea among Amphitrite�s waves . 
So I come to clasp your knees , and ask you to speak if you can , and will , of his sad death , a death you may have seen yourself , or heard tell of from other travellers : for he was a man whom his mother bore to sorrow beyond all men . 
And do not speak soothing words out of concern for me , or pity , but tell me , in truth , what news you have . if ever my father , good 
Odysseus , promised you word or action and fulfilled it , on that field of 
Troy where 
Achaeans suffered , I beg you , remember it now : tell me the whole truth . / 
The horseman , 
Nestor of 
Gerenia , answered him : �Friend , you bring to mind the pain we suffered there , we sons of 
Achaea , great in courage : all that suffering of ours aboard ship , sailing the misty deep after plunder wherever 
Achilles 
led , and all our battles around 
King Priam�s mighty 
city , where the best of us died . 
There lies ajax , beloved of ares : there lie 
Achilles and Patroclus , equal to the gods in counsel . 
There lies my own dear son , 
Antilochus , strong and faultless , swift of foot , and great in battle . 
Who among mortal men could tell all the evils we suffered ? if you remained here five or six years , and heard of the troubles the noble 
Achaeans endured there you would be weary before the end , and go home . for nine years we were busy planning their destruction with all known stratagems , but 
Zeus , the son of 
Cronos , made it hard to achieve . No man there dared to compete in counsel with 
Odysseus , your father if you are truly his son , since noble 
Odysseus was supreme in all known stratagems . I wonder as I gaze at you : your speech is exactly his , and one would hardly expect a younger man to speak so . Throughout those years , 
Odysseus and I never spoke on opposite sides , in council or assembly , but with one mind advised the 
Argives , wisely and shrewdly , how to achieve success . but when we had sacked Priam�s high citadel , and sailed away , and a god had scattered the fleet , then 
Zeus planned a grievous journey for the 
Argives , because some had behaved incautiously and unjustly . 
Many came to a dark fate , through the fierce anger of the bright-eyed goddess , daughter of a mighty father , stirring a quarrel between Atreus� two sons . 
Hastily and informally , 
they called the 
Achaeans to an assembly at sunset , and because of it the sons of 
Achaea arrived sodden with wine . 
Then 
they spoke , and explained why 
they had gathered the host . 
Menelaus suggested 
they made their return over the wide sea the priority , but this displeased 
Agamemnon , who wished to delay them there , and to offer holy sacrifice to appease Athene�s deadly anger , not knowing foolishly that she would not listen , since the will of the everlasting gods cannot be swiftly altered . 
So the two of them stood there , exchanging harsh words , until the bronze-greaved 
Achaeans , divided in opinion , broke up in almighty uproar . � / �That night we rested , each side nursing harsh thoughts against the other , for 
Zeus was preparing a deadly blow . in the morning half of us launched our ships on the glittering sea , stowing away our goods , loading the captive women in their low-necked robes . 
Half of the army held back , supporting 
Agamemnon , Atreus�s son , the shepherd of the flock , while the rest of us embarked , then gathered way . / 
The ships sailed swiftly , for a god had smoothed the sea that nurtures monsters . 
Making 
Tenedos , and desirous of reaching home , we sacrificed to the immortals , but 
Zeus , that recalcitrant deity , did not wish us to return yet , and stirred another bitter quarrel . At that point one squadron , under the wise and cunning lord 
Odysseus , who once more favoured 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son , swung their curved prows about , and turned back . I , with a massed fleet of ships following me , sailed on , knowing the god intended trouble . 
Diomedes , Tydeus� son , beloved of ares , likewise drove his crews onward , and behind us sailed yellow-haired 
Menelaus . 
He caught us at 
Lesbos as we argued whether to head out west from rugged 
Chios , towards the island of 
Psyria , keeping it to larboard , or to sail south , landward of 
Chios , past Mimas� windy promontories . We asked the god for a sign , and the god made it clear we 
should cut across open sea , westward to 
Euboea , to escape from trouble most quickly . a fierce wind blew , and the ships ran swiftly over the teeming deep , and that night put in to 
Geraestus . 
There we laid many a bull�s thigh on Poseidon�s altar , to give thanks for our crossing . on the fourth day from then 
Diomedes , Tydeus� son , tamer of horses , and all his company , beached their fine ships at 
Argos , but I sailed on for 
Pylos , and the wind never dropped from the moment the god first made it blow . / 
So , dear boy , I reached home without news of the others , knowing nothing of which 
Achaeans were saved , and which were lost . but you have a right to all the news I have heard as I sit here in my palace , and I will keep nothing back . 
They say that the myrmidons returned safely , those fierce spearmen that 
Achilles once 
led , and 
Philoctetes returned too , Poias� brilliant son . 
And 
Idomeneus brought those of his troops who escaped the war back to 
Crete , and none were lost at sea . as for that son of 
Atreus , 
Agamemnon , you will have heard , far off though you were , of his homecoming , and of how 
Aegisthus plotted his sad end . 
Yet he too paid a terrible price , showing how good it is that a man leaves a son behind to take vengeance on his murderer . for 
Orestes took vengeance on his father�s killer , crafty 
Aegisthus , for all his treachery . 
You too , friend , a fine tall man as I see , take courage , so that many a man of generations yet to be born shall praise you . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �Nestor , son of 
Neleus , great glory of the 
Achaeans , his son indeed took vengeance , and the 
Achaeans will noise his fame abroad , so that generations yet to be born will hear . 
Would that the gods would grant me such power , that I might exact a like revenge on the 
Suitors for their heavy sins , and the wilful wrongs 
they perpetrate against me . but the gods weave no such joys for me , or my father : I must simply endure . � / 
Nestor , the 
Gerenian charioteer , replied : �Friend , your words remind me : 
they say a crowd of 
Suitors courting your mother commit evils in your palace against you . tell me , do you submit to this willingly , or is it that the people of Ithaca have turned against you , spurred on by the voice of some god ? 
Who knows whether 
Odysseus may not return one day , alone or with an 
Achaean host , and take vengeance on them for their violence ? if only bright-eyed 
Athene would choose to love you , as she once cherished noble 
Odysseus on the 
Trojan fields where we 
Achaeans suffered . I have never seen a god show love so openly , as 
Pallas 
Athene showed to him , standing there by his side . if she delighted in loving you like that , and cared deeply for you , then the whole crowd of them could forget about marriage . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered him : �Venerable lord , I doubt that what you say could ever be . 
You speak of something too wonderful . 
There is no hope of it , even if the gods so willed it . � / 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , spoke to him : �Telemachus , what are you saying ? a god who wills it can easily bring a man safely home , from however far away . I would rather endure great suffering , myself , before I reached home , than be 
killed at my own hearth later , as 
Agamemnon was 
killed by the cunning of 
Aegisthus , and his own wife . but still the gods themselves cannot keep death , the common fate , from a man 
they love , when the deadly hand of merciless destiny fells him . � / �Mentor , � 
said wise 
Telemachus , �let us be silent now about these grievous things . 
He can no longer return : on the contrary the deathless ones have brought death�s dark fate to him . but there is another question I would ask of 
Nestor , since he above all understands wisdom and judgement : men say he has been king for three lives of men , and he seems to me one of the immortals . 
Nestor , son of 
Neleus , tell me truly how that great king , 
Agamemnon , son of 
Atreus , was 
killed ? 
Where was 
Menelaus , then ? 
How did crafty 
Aegisthus plan to kill the king , a man far stronger than himself ? 
Was 
Menelaus not home in 
Achaean 
Argos , but roaming abroad , that 
Aegisthus had the courage to commit the murder ? / 
Nestor , the 
Gerenian charioteer , replied : �I will tell you truly , my child , as you ask . 
You can guess yourself how it would have ended if yellow-haired 
Menelaus , Atreus� son , returning from 
Troy , had found 
Aegisthus alive in the palace . none would even have heaped a burial mound for him : dogs and birds would have torn his flesh on the plain , far outside the 
city , and no woman of 
Achaea would have mourned him , because of his monstrous crime . We played our part at 
Troy completing our many tasks , but he idled in that haven of 
Argos , the horse-pasture , seducing Agamemnon�s wife with his chatter . At first the noble 
Clytaemnestra , in her wisdom , shunned the base act : and besides she had a minstrel with her to whom 
Agamemnon had given strict orders to guard his wife , when he left for 
Troy . but when the gods at last destined that 
Agamemnon 
should be destroyed , 
Aegisthus took the minstrel to a desert isle , and left him there as a gift for the birds of prey : and as he wished , and she wished , 
led her to his own house . 
And he burned great heaps of thigh-pieces on the gods� holy altar , and hung up rich offerings of fine fabrics , and gold , when he had accomplished that dreadful murder , which in his heart he had never thought could succeed . / for 
Agamemnon and I had sailed , in friendship , together from 
Troy : but when we came to sacred 
Sunium , the cape south of 
Athens , Phoebus 
Apollo 
killed Menelaus� helmsman with a painless arrow , while his hands gripped the tiller of the speeding craft . 
And 
Phrontis , son of 
Onetor , had been first among men at steering a ship when the storm winds blew . 
So , though 
Menelaus was anxious to sail on , he waited to bury his friend , and offered the funeral rites . 
Then when he got away in his hollow ships , over the wine-dark sea , and ran downwind to Malea�s steep headland , 
Zeus of the far-reaching voice destined a troubled course for him , and engulfed him in a roaring gale , swelling the waves to the height of mountains . 
Then he split the fleet apart , carrying some ships to 
Crete and the 
Cydonian lands on the river 
Iardanus . 
There is a sheer cliff , falling to the sea , in the misty waves on the borders of 
Gortyn , where the southwest winds drive great breakers against the western headland near 
Phaestus , and a slender reef stems their flow . 
Reaching it , the waves smashed the ships against the rocks , and the men barely escaped destruction . / 
However , wind and wave had carried five of the blue-prowed vessels to Egypt . 
So 
Menelaus cruised there with his ships among men of foreign tongue , gathering goods and gold . 
Meanwhile 
Aegisthus plotted his tragic action at home , murdering 
Agamemnon , and then controlling his people . 
He ruled gold-rich 
Mycenae for seven years , but the eighth brought 
Orestes his doom from 
Athens , come to slay his father�s murderer , crafty 
Aegisthus , in revenge . 
And when he had slain him , he called the 
Argives to a funeral feast , over the bodies of his vile mother and cowardly 
Aegisthus : and on that very day 
Menelaus of the loud war cry returned , bringing rich treasure , all that his ships could carry . � / �So do not wander far from home , yourself , my friend , leaving your wealth behind , and insolent men in your palace , for fear 
they share out your riches and consume them , making your journey worthless . I urge you to visit 
Menelaus , since he returned later from those distant parts , that region from which one might fear never to return , being driven by storms into the wide sea that birds cross only twice a year , so vast it is , and dangerous . Go with your ship and crew , or if you prefer the land here is a chariot and team , and my sons are at your service , that can guide you to lovely 
Lacedaemon , where yellow-haired 
Menelaus lives . 
Ask for the truth from his lips , yourself . 
He , being wise , will not deceive you . � / as 
Nestor 
ceased , the sun dipped and darkness fell . 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene spoke to them : �Venerable lord , you have 
said truly . but come , cut up the tongues , and mix the wine , so that we may pour the libations to 
Poseidon and the other gods , then think of sleep . 
It is time , since the light fades into darkness , and we 
should not sit too long at the gods� feast , but go to our beds . � / 
So the daughter of 
Zeus spoke , and 
they paid attention to her words . squires poured water over their hands , while young men filled the brimming bowls , and after sprinkling a few drops into the wine-cups , as a libation , 
handed them round . 
Then 
they placed the tongues in the fire , and rising to their feet poured libations on them . but when 
they had offered the wine and drunk deep themselves , 
Athene and godlike 
Telemachus were ready to return to their hollow ship . 
Nestor , though detained them , saying : / �May 
Zeus and the other immortals forbid this , that you 
should leave me and go to your swift ship , as if I were a beggar in rags , who lacks soft cloaks and blankets in plenty on which his guests might sleep . I have both , and the steadfast son of 
Odysseus shall not sleep on his ship�s deck while I am alive , or sons survive me here , to welcome strangers who reach my door . � Bright-eyed 
Athene 
said : �You have spoken well , my lord , and 
Telemachus 
should stay : that will be best . but while he follows you , and shall sleep in your palace , I will go to the black ship to explain , and to reassure our crew . for I am the oldest among them : 
they are youths , friends of like age to the great-hearted 
Telemachus 
they follow . I will sleep there , by the black ship�s hull , tonight . 
And in the morning I will head for the great-hearted 
Cauconians , who owe me a heavy and long-standing debt . 
Then , since this young man is your guest , send him on his way , by chariot , with your son beside him , and let his horses be the strongest and swiftest you have . � / 
So the goddess spoke , bright-eyed 
Athene , and flew off in the form of a sea eagle : and all were amazed at the sight . 
The 
old man marvelled when he saw , and clasping Telemachus� hand he 
said : �Friend , you will prove neither a fool nor a coward since the gods go with you to guide you , and you so young . for this was none other of the gods that live on Olympus but the lady of 
Lake 
Tritonis , the glorious virgin daughter of 
Zeus , who granted your noble father honour too among 
Argives . 
Queen , be gracious to me , and let them speak well of me and my sons , and the wife I revere : and in return I will offer a wide-browed yearling heifer , not yet broken to the plough . I will gild her horns and sacrifice her to you . � / 
He 
prayed , and 
Pallas 
Athene heard . 
Then the horseman , 
Gerenian 
Nestor , with his sons , and sons-in-law , 
led the way to his lovely home . 
And , reaching the king�s fine palace , 
they seated themselves in rows on the chairs and stools : and the 
old man mixed them a sweet bowl of wine , from a sealed jar the housekeeper opened , now , in its eleventh year . 
Mixing a bowl of the vintage , the 
old man poured libations , and 
prayed intently to 
Athene , the daughter of 
Zeus , who wears the aegis . / After pouring libations , and drinking their fill , 
they each went off to rest , while 
Nestor , the horseman of 
Gerenia , arranged for the steadfast son of divine 
Odysseus to sleep on a wooden bed in the echoing portico , with 
Peisistratus , of the ash spear , leader of men , and the only unmarried son left in the palace , beside him . but 
Nestor himself slept in the innermost room of the tall building , and with him his lady wife for love and comfort . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
Nestor the 
Gerenian horseman rose from his bed : went out , and seated himself on the smooth stone bench , white and gleaming as though with oil , that stood in front of the high doors . 
Neleus had once sat there , as wise as a god in counsel , but he had long since been felled by fate and gone down to Hades� halls . 
Now 
Gerenian 
Nestor sat there in his turn , a 
Warden of the 
Achaeans , with the sceptre in his hand . His sons gathered round him , as 
they came from their rooms , 
Echephron and 
Stratius , 
Perseus , 
Aretus , and godlike 
Thrasymedes . 
The warrior 
Peisistratus made a sixth , and 
they seated godlike 
Telemachus beside him . 
Nestor , the 
Gerenian horseman , spoke first : / 
My dear sons , be quick to do my will , so that I can propitiate 
Athene above all , who came openly in person to the god�s rich feast . let one of you go to the meadow for a heifer , and let the cowherd drive her swiftly : let another go to great-hearted Telemachus� black ship and bring his friends , all but two : and let a third call 
Laerces the goldsmith here to tip the heifer�s horns with gold . 
The rest of you stay here , and tell the women to prepare a feast in the palace , and seats , and firewood , and fresh water . � / 
They set about their tasks , as ordered . 
The heifer arrived from the meadow , and great-hearted Telemachus� crew from the fine swift ship : the smith brought bronze tools in his hands , anvil , hammer and well-wrought tongs , the instruments of his gold-working craft : and 
Athene too arrived to witness the sacrifice . 
Then 
old 
Nestor the charioteer gave the smith gold to gild the heifer�s horns , so the goddess would delight in the offering . 
Then 
Stratius and noble 
Echephron 
led the heifer by the horns , and 
Aretus came from the palace bringing water in a flowered bowl for them to wash with , and a basket of barley meal , in his other hand . 
Thrasymedes , stalwart in fighting , stood there , gripping a sharp axe to strike the heifer , and 
Perseus held the dish for the blood . 
Then 
old 
Nestor the charioteer opened the rites by washing his hands and scattering barley grains , and 
prayed intently to 
Athene , cutting hair from the victim�s head as a first offering , and throwing it into the flames . / 
When 
they had 
prayed , and scattered the barley grains , 
Thrasymedes , Nestor�s high-spirited son , approached and struck the blow . 
The axe severed the sinews of the heifer�s neck , and crippled her strength , and the women raised the ritual cry , all the daughters , and daughters-in-law , and Nestor�s honoured wife , 
Eurydice , Clymenus� eldest daughter . 
Then the men raised the heifer�s head from the trampled earth , and held it while 
Peisistratus , that leader of men , slit its throat . 
When the black blood had flowed , and life had left its body , 
they dismembered the carcass , cut out the thigh pieces accordingly , wrapped them in layers of fat , and covered them with raw meat . 
Then the 
old king burned them on the fire , and poured glowing wine over them , while the young men waited beside him , five-pronged forks in hand . 
When the thigh pieces were burned , then 
they tasted the inner parts , carving the rest , skewering and roasting it , holding the sharpened skewers in their hands . / 
Then lovely 
Polycaste , Nestor�s youngest daughter , bathed 
Telemachus . 
And when she had bathed him and rubbed him with oil , and dressed him in tunic and fine cloak , he emerged from the baths like an immortal , and seated himself by 
Nestor , the people�s shepherd . / 
When 
they had roasted the outer flesh and stripped it from the skewers , 
they sat down to eat , with squires in attendance to fill their wine-cups . After 
they had sated themselves with food and drink , 
Nestor , the 
Gerenian horseman was first to speak : �Now , my sons , harness horses with flowing manes to Telemachus� chariot , so he may start his journey . � / 
He spoke , and 
they eagerly heard and obeyed : rapidly harnessing swift horses to the chariot . 
The housekeeper stocked it with bread and wine , and delicacies , such as kings eat whom 
Zeus favours . 
Then 
Telemachus mounted the fine chariot , and 
Peisistratus , leader of men , Nestor�s son , climbed up beside him and grasped the reins in his hands . 
He flicked the team with his whip to start them , and the willing pair took to the plain , and left the high 
city of 
Pylos behind them . 
And all day long 
they strained at the yoke across their necks . / 
Now the sun dipped and the roads grew dark . 
And 
they came to 
Pherae , to Diocles� house , Ortilochus� son whom 
Alpheius bore . 
There 
they passed the night , and he welcomed them , as strangers 
should be welcomed . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
they harnessed the horses , mounted the ornate chariot , and drove past the echoing portico out of the gate . 
Then 
Peistratus flicked the team with his whip to start them , and the willing pair flew onwards . 
So 
they came to plains of wheat , and pushed on towards journey�s end , drawn by their fleeting horses . 
And the sun dipped down and all the roads grew dark . /
