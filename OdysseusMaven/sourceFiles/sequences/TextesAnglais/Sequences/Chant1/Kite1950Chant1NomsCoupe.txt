tell me , muse , of that man of many resources , who wandered far and wide , after sacking the holy citadel of 
Troy . 
Many the men whose cities he saw , whose ways he learned . 
Many the sorrows he suffered at sea , while trying to bring himself and his friends back alive . 
Yet despite his wishes he failed to save them , because of their own un-wisdom , foolishly eating the cattle of 
Helios , the 
Sun , so the god denied them their return . tell us of these things , beginning where you will , 
Goddess , 
Daughter of 
Zeus . / 
Now , all the others , who had escaped destruction , had reached their homes , and were free of sea and war . 
He alone , longing for wife and home , 
Calypso , the 
Nymph , kept in her echoing cavern , desiring him for a husband . not even when the changing seasons brought the year the gods had chosen for his return to Ithaca was he free from danger , and among friends . 
Yet all the gods pitied him , except 
Poseidon , who continued his relentless anger against godlike 
Odysseus until he reached his own land at last . / 
Now , though , 
Poseidon was visiting the distant Ethiopians , the most remote of all , a divided people , some of whom live where 
Hyperion sets the others where he rises , to accept a hetacomb of sacrificial bulls and rams , and there he sat , enjoying the feast : but the rest of the gods had gathered in the halls of 
Olympian 
Zeus . 
The 
Father of gods and men was first to address them , for he was thinking of flawless 
Aegisthus , whom far-famed 
Orestes , Agamemnon�s son had killed . 
And , thinking of him , he spoke to the immortals . / �How surprising that men blame the gods , and say their troubles come from us , though 
they , through their own un-wisdom , find suffering beyond what is fated . 
Just as 
Aegisthus , beyond what was fated , took the wife of 
Agamemnon , son of 
Atreus , and murdered him when he returned , though he knew the end would be a complete disaster , since we sent 
Hermes , keen-eyed slayer of argus , to warn him not to kill the man , or court his wife , as 
Orestes would avenge 
Agamemnon , once he reached manhood and longed for his own land . 
So 
Hermes told him , but despite his kind intent he 
could not move 
Aegisthus� heart : and Aegisthus has paid the price now for it all . � / 
Athene , the bright-eyed goddess , answered him at once : �Father of us all , son of 
Cronos , 
Highest 
King , clearly that man deserved to be destroyed : so let all be destroyed who act as he did . but my heart aches for 
Odysseus , wise but ill fated , who suffers far from his friends on an 
island deep in the sea . 
The 
island is densely wooded and a goddess lives there , a child of malevolent atlas , he who knows the depths of the sea , and supports the great columns that separate earth and sky . 
It is his daughter who detains that unlucky , sorrowful man : she lulls him , always , with soft seductive words , intending him to forget Ithaca . but 
Odysseus , who yearns for the mere sight of the smoke rising from his own country , only longs to die . 
Yet , 
Olympian , your heart is unmoved . 
Did he win no favour with the sacrifices he made you , by the Argive ships , on the wide plains of 
Troy ? 
Why do you will this man such pain , 
Zeus ? � / 
Cloud-Gathering 
Zeus answered her then : �My child , what words escape your lips ? 
How 
could I ever forget godlike 
Odysseus , who exceeds all mortals in wisdom , and also in sacrifice to the deathless gods who inhabit the broad heavens ? 
It is 
Poseidon , the 
Earth-Bearer , who is always filled with implacable anger against him , because of godlike 
Polyphemus , the strongest 
Cyclops of all , whom 
Odysseus blinded . 
The nymph Thoosa bore him , daughter of Phorcys who rules the barren sea : she slept with 
Poseidon in the hollow caves . Since that blinding , 
Poseidon , the 
Earth-Shaker , though he will not kill him , keeps 
Odysseus far from his native land . 
Come , let all here plan how he might come home : then 
Poseidon will relent , since he�ll not be able to contend , alone , against all the deathless gods together . � / 
The goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , answered him : �Father of us all , son of 
Cronos , 
Highest 
King , if it truly pleases the blessed gods for wise 
Odysseus to return home , let us send 
Hermes , the 
Messenger , 
Slayer of argus , to the isle of 
Ogygia , so he can tell the 
Nymph with the lovely tresses of our unalterable decision , that long-suffering 
Odysseus may come home . Meanwhile I will go to Ithaca , to stir his son , and encourage him to call the long-haired 
Achaeans together , and speak his mind to the 
Suitors who slaughter his flocks of sheep , and his shambling cattle with twisted horns . 
Then I will lead him to Sparta and sandy 
Pylos to gain news of his loyal father�s return , if he can , and so win praise . � / 
So saying , she bound to her feet her beautiful sandals of imperishable gold that would carry her over the waves , over the wide lands , as swiftly as the wind . 
And she took her heavy spear , great and strong , with its tip of sharpened bronze , with which she destroys the ranks of men , and heroes , when that daughter of a mighty father is angered . 
Then she flew down from the heights of Olympus , and reaching Ithaca stood at Odysseus� gate , at the threshold of the court . She appeared as a visitor , mentes , chief of the 
Taphians , bronze spear in hand . 
There she found the insolent suitors , sitting in front of the doors , on ox hides from beasts 
they had slaughtered themselves , playing at counters : their pages and squires were busy mixing water and wine in bowls , others were wiping tables with sponges then laying them , while others were setting out plentiful servings of meat . / 
Godlike 
Telemachus , sitting troubled among the suitors , imagining how his noble father might arrive from somewhere , throw the suitors from the palace , win honour and rule his own again , was first to see her . 
Thinking of it , sitting among the suitors , he saw 
Athene , and went straight to the doorway , ashamed a stranger should wait so long at the gates . 
Approaching her , he clasped her right hand , took her spear of bronze , and spoke to her winged words : �Welcome , stranger , here you will find hospitality , and after you have eaten you may tell us why you are here . � / At this , he 
led the way , and 
Pallas 
Athene followed . once inside the high hall , he took the spear and set it in a polished rack by a tall pillar , with other spears that belonged to loyal 
Odysseus . 
He 
led 
Athene herself to a handsome , richly carved chair , spread a linen cloth over it , and seated her there with a footstool for her feet . 
He drew up on ornate stool for himself , as well , away from the 
Suitors , lest the stranger should shun the food , annoyed by the din , finding himself in a crowd of insolent men : and so he might ask news of his absent father . 
Next a maid brought water in a fine gold jug , and poured it over a silver basin , so 
they 
could rinse their hands : then drew up a polished table . 
The housekeeper silently brought them bread , and various delicacies , drawing liberally on her store . 
And a carver lifted plates of different meats , and set them down with gold cups beside them , while a steward , constantly walking by , poured the wine . / 
The insolent 
Suitors entered and sat in rows on stools and chairs . squires poured water over their hands , while maids piled bread in baskets beside them , and pages filled bowls with wine : and 
they reached for the good things spread before them . 
Then when the 
Suitors had satisfied hunger and thirst , their thoughts turned elsewhere , to song and dance , since these things crown a feast . a herald placed a fine lyre in the hands of 
Phemius , whom the 
Suitors had forced to sing for them : and he struck the chords to begin his pleasant song . / 
Then 
Telemachus spoke to bright-eyed 
Athene , his head close to hers , so the others 
could not hear : �My friend , will you be angered at what I say ? 
These men amuse themselves with music and song , freely , since 
they consume another�s wealth without repayment , one whose white bones are tumbling in the waves , or rotting in the rain on some far shore . if 
they saw him here in Ithaca 
they would pray for swifter feet , rather than rich clothes and gold . but now he is dead of an evil fate , and we have no comfort , even if someone on Earth were to claim he would return , the day he 
could is past . but tell me this , and speak truly : who are you and where do you come from ? 
What 
city is yours , who are your parents ? 
What kind of vessel brought you , and whom did the sailors say 
they were , and how did 
they land you on Ithaca , for I doubt you came on foot ? 
And tell me this , too , is this truly your first visit here , or are you a friend of my father�s ? 
Many are those who entered our house as guests , for he too travelled widely among men . � / 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , answered : �Well I will tell you all , openly . I am mentes , wise Anchialus� son , lord of the sea-going 
Taphians . 
Now , as you see , with my ship and crew I beach here , in my journey over the wine-dark sea to foreign-speaking 
Temese , trading for copper and carrying glittering iron . 
My ship lies over there , away from the 
city , next to open land , in 
Rheithron 
Harbour , and below wooded 
Neion . let us call each other friend , as our fathers did , friends of old . Go and ask that old hero , 
Laertes , if you like , who no longer comes to the palace 
they say , but endures his sorrows far off in the fields with an aged woman for servant , who serves his food and drink when weariness grips his limbs , as he toils among the slopes of his vineyard . I came , because men said that 
Odysseus was here among his people , but the gods seem to have prevented his returning , since he has not vanished from the earth yet . I imagine he�s alive and a prisoner on some 
island in the wide sea , held by cruel and savage folk , who keep him there by force . 
Though I am no seer , nor trained in augury , I will prophesy to you what the immortal gods put in my mind , and what I believe will be . 
Though iron shackles hold him , he will not be kept from his own land much longer . a man of many resources , he will find a way to return . but tell me truly if you , tall as you are , are really Odysseus� son . 
Your head and your fine eyes are amazingly like him , for we were often together before he set out for 
Troy , where the bravest of the 
Argives sailed in their hollow ships . but I have never seen 
Odysseus since that day , nor he me . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered : �I will speak honestly . 
My mother says I am his son , but I do not know , for none can be certain of his own parentage . if only I had been the son of some lucky man who spent old age among his own possessions ! as it is , 
they say , since you ask , that I am born of the unluckiest of mortal men . � / 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , 
replied : �Yet with 
Penelope for your mother the gods have ensured your line will not be unknown . but tell me , in truth , what is this feast , these folk ? 
Why is this needed ? Is it a banquet or a wedding celebration ? It�s clearly not one where each brings his own provisions , since imperiously , insolently , 
they feast in your house . 
Any man of sense who mixed with them would be angered at the sight of these shameful actions . � / 
Then wise 
Telemachus answered : �Stranger , since you ask the question , our house once seemed made for wealth and honour , when 
Odysseus was with his people . but the gods have willed otherwise since then , with their dark designs , for unlike other men 
they have made him vanish . if he had been killed among his friends at 
Troy , or died in the arms of friends with the war ended , his death itself would grieve me less . 
Then the 
Achaean host would have built his tomb , and he would have won a fine name for his son to inherit . in fact the harpies have snatched him , without trace : he is beyond sight and hearing , and leaves me in sorrow and tears : nor do I sigh and groan for him alone , for the gods have granted me other painful troubles . 
All the princes who rule the islands , 
Dulichium , 
Same , and wooded 
Zacynthus , and all the lords of rocky Ithaca court my mother and consume my wealth with their feasts : soon 
they will destroy me , too . � / 
Moved to anger , 
Pallas 
Athene spoke : �Ah , you have dire need of lost 
Odysseus , to set hands on these shameless 
Suitors . if only he were standing at the palace gates now , with his helmet and shield and twin spears , just as when I first saw him at my house , drinking joyously , on his way home from 
Ephyre , after his visit to Ilus , Mermerus� son . 
Odysseus went there as well , in his swift ship , in search of a deadly poison to smear on the tips of his bronze-headed arrows . Ilus was in awe of the deathless gods and refused him , but my father who loved him dearly did not . if only 
Odysseus , I say , as he was , 
could confront the 
Suitors : 
they would meet death swiftly , and a dark wedding . but , indeed , it lies in the lap of the gods whether he will return and take vengeance in his palace , or not : but I urge you yourself to plan how to drive these 
Suitors from the house . / 
Come , listen , and note my words . 
Call the 
Achaean lords together tomorrow : speak to them all , with the gods for witness . tell the 
Suitors to disperse , each to his home : and if your mother�s heart urges her to marry , let her go back to her great father�s house , where 
they will ready a wedding feast , and a wealth of gifts , fitting for a well-beloved daughter . 
And I will give you good advice , if you will hear me . man the best ship you have with twenty oarsmen , go and seek news of your absent father . Some mortal may tell you , or perhaps a rumour sent by 
Zeus to bring news to men . Go to 
Pylos first , and question the noble 
Nestor : then to Sparta to yellow-haired 
Menelaus , last of the bronze-clad 
Achaeans to reach home . if you hear your father is living , and sailing home , then however troubled you are , endure for another year . but if you hear he is dead , return to your own land , build a mound , with all the funeral rites , generous ones as is fitting , and give your mother away to a new husband . When you have settled and done all this , use heart and mind to plan how to kill the 
Suitors in your palace , openly or by guile : since it is not right for you to follow childish ways , being no more a child . Perhaps you have not heard what fame 
Orestes won among men , destroying his father�s murderer , cunning 
Aegisthus , for killing his noble father ? 
You too take courage , my friend , since I see you are tall and fine , so that many a man unborn will praise you . but now I must go to my swift ship , and my crew who will be weary of waiting . 
Take note yourself of my words , and consider them . / 
Wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Stranger , truly , you speak kindly like a father to his son , and I will never forget your words . but stay a while , though you are eager to be gone , so that when you have bathed and eased your heart , you can go to your ship in good spirits , taking a rich and beautiful gift from me as a keepsake , such as stranger gives to stranger in friendship . � 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , answered him : �Do not detain me longer , since I am eager to go , but whatever gift your heart prompts you to send home with me , give it to me when I return , choosing one of the loveliest , and it will bring you good value in exchange . � / 
So the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , spoke , and vanished , soaring upwards like a bird . in his heart she had stirred fortitude and daring , and made him think of his father even more . 
He felt what had passed in his spirit , and was awed , realising a god had been with him , and godlike himself he at once rejoined the 
Suitors . / as 
they sat listening in silence , the famous minstrel sang to them of the Achaeans� troubled return from 
Troy , inflicted by 
Pallas 
Athene . 
Wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , heard his marvellous song from her chamber , and descended the stairs , accompanied by her two maids . as she neared the 
Suitors she drew her shining veil across her face , and stopped by the doorpost of the well-made hall , a loyal handmaid on either side . 
Then , with tear-filled eyes , she spoke to the divine bard : / �Phemius , you know many another tale of men and gods , that the bards made famous , with which to charm us mortals . 
Sing one of those while you sit here , as 
they drink their wine in silence , but end this sad song that always troubles the heart in my breast , since above all women I bear a sadness not to be forgotten . I ever remember my husband�s dear face , he whose fame resounds through Hellas to the heart of 
Argos . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered her : �Mother , why grudge the good bard his right to please us as the spirit stirs him ? Bards are not to blame , surely : it is 
Zeus we must blame , who deals with each eater of bread as he wishes . No one can be angry if this man sings the Danaans� dark fate : since men always praise the most the newest song 
they hear . 
Suffer you heart and mind to listen , for 
Odysseus was not alone in failing to return from 
Troy , many another perished too . 
So go to your quarters now , and attend to your own duties at loom and spindle , and order your maids about their tasks : let men worry about such things , and I especially , since I hold the authority in this house . � / 
Seized with wonder she retired to her own room , taking her son�s wise words to heart . 
Up to her high chamber she went , accompanied by her maids , and there she wept for 
Odysseus , her dear husband , till bright-eyed 
Athene 
veiled her eyelids with sweet sleep . / but throughout the shadowy hall the 
Suitors created uproar , with each man praying he might bed her . 
Wise 
Telemachus was then the first to speak : �My mother�s 
Suitors , proud in your insolence , let us enjoy the feast for now , but without disturbance , since it is a lovely thing to listen to such a bard as this , with his godlike voice . 
Then , in the morning , let us take our seats in the assembly , so I can declare to you all you must leave the palace . Feast elsewhere , move from house to house , and eat your own provisions . if it seems preferable , more profitable to you , to waste one man�s estate without restitution , then do so , but I meanwhile will call on the eternal gods hoping that 
Zeus might grant a day of reckoning . 
Then you will be wasted in my halls , without restitution . � / 
So he spoke , and 
they bit their lips , amazed at Telemachus� bold speech . 
Then 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , 
replied : �Telemachus , the gods themselves must have taught you this bold , high style . 
May the son of 
Cronos never make you king of Ithaca�s isle , though it is your heritage by birth . � / 
Then wise 
Telemachus answered him : �Will it anger you , 
Antinous , if I say that I should be pleased to accept it from Zeus� hand . do you think , in truth , it is the worst fate for a man ? 
It is no bad thing to be a king . At once your house grows rich , and you are held in higher honour . but there are many other kings for the 
Achaeans , young and old , in Ithaca�s isle . Perhaps one of them will have the honour , since noble 
Odysseus is dead . but I will be master of my own house , and of the servants noble 
Odysseus gathered for me . � / 
Then 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , 
replied : �Surely , 
Telemachus , the question of who will be king , in Ithaca�s isle , is in the lap of the gods : and as for your possessions , keep them , and be master in your own house . 
While men live in Ithaca , let no man come and snatch your possessions from you , violently , or against your will . but I am prompted to ask , dear sir , where has that stranger come from ? 
What country does he claim as his ? 
Where are his kin , and native land ? 
Does he bring news of your father�s arrival , or did he come here on his own account ? 
How he leapt up and vanished ! 
He would not wait to be known , though he seemed no common man . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered him , saying : �Eurymachus , surely my father has lost his chance to return . I no longer put my faith in rumours , wherever 
they come from , nor do I note the prophecies my mother may hear , from some diviner she has called to the palace . 
The stranger is a friend of my father�s from 
Taphos . 
He announced he is mentes , the son of wise 
Anchialus , lord of the sea-going 
Taphians . � / 
So 
Telemachus spoke , yet in his heart he knew it was the deathless goddess . / 
Now 
they turned to dancing , heart-felt song , and enjoyment , till nightfall . 
Then each went to his house to rest . but 
Telemachus went to his bed with his mind full of thoughts , to his room high above the fine courtyard , with its clear view : and faithful 
Eurycleia , daughter of 
Ops , Peisenor�s son , carrying a blazing torch , waited on him . 
Laertes had bought her himself long ago , when she was still quite young , at the cost of twenty oxen , and honoured her in his palace as he honoured his loyal wife , never lying with her for fear of his wife�s anger . 
Now she carried the blazing torches for 
Telemachus , since of all the women it was she who loved him most , having nursed him as a child . 
He opened the door to the well-made room , and sitting on the bed took off his soft tunic , and placed it in the wise old woman�s hands . 
Folding and smoothing the tunic , she hung it on a peg by the wooden bedstead , and went out of the room , closing the door by its silver handle , shooting the bolt by means of its leather thong . 
There , all night long , wrapped in a woollen fleece , 
Telemachus planned in his mind the journey 
Athene proposed . / tell me , muse , of that man of many resources , who wandered far and wide , after sacking the holy citadel of 
Troy . 
Many the men whose cities he saw , whose ways he learned . 
Many the sorrows he suffered at sea , while trying to bring himself and his friends back alive . 
Yet despite his wishes he failed to save them , because of their own un-wisdom , foolishly eating the cattle of 
Helios , the 
Sun , so the god denied them their return . tell us of these things , beginning where you will , 
Goddess , 
Daughter of 
Zeus . /

Calypso , the 
Nymph , kept in her echoing cavern , desiring him for a husband . not even when the changing seasons brought the year the gods had chosen for his return to Ithaca was he free from danger , and among friends . 
Yet all the gods pitied him , except 
Poseidon , who continued his relentless anger against godlike 
Odysseus until he reached his own land at last . / 
Now , though , 
Poseidon was visiting the distant Ethiopians , the most remote of all , a divided people , some of whom live where 
Hyperion sets the others where he rises , to accept a hetacomb of sacrificial bulls and rams , and there he sat , enjoying the feast : but the rest of the gods had gathered in the halls of 
Olympian 
Zeus . 
The 
Father of gods and men was first to address them , for he was thinking of flawless 
Aegisthus , whom far-famed 
Orestes , Agamemnon�s son had killed . 
And , thinking of him , he spoke to the immortals . / �How surprising that men blame the gods , and say their troubles come from us , though

Now , as you see , with my ship and crew I beach here , in my journey over the wine-dark sea to foreign-speaking 
Temese , trading for copper and carrying glittering iron . 
My ship lies over there , away from the 
city , next to open land , in 
Rheithron 
Harbour , and below wooded 
Neion . let us call each other friend , as our fathers did , friends of old . Go and ask that old hero , 
Laertes , if you like , who no longer comes to the palace 
they say , but endures his sorrows far off in the fields with an aged woman for servant , who serves his food and drink when weariness grips his limbs , as he toils among the slopes of his vineyard . I came , because men said that 
Odysseus was here among his people , but the gods seem to have prevented his returning , since he has not vanished from the earth yet . I imagine he�s alive and a prisoner on some 
island in the wide sea , held by cruel and savage folk , who keep him there by force . 
Though I am no seer , nor trained in augury , I will prophesy to you what the immortal gods put in my mind , and what I believe will be . 
Though iron shackles hold him , he will not be kept from his own land much longer . a man of many resources , he will find a way to return . but tell me truly if you , tall as you are , are really Odysseus� son . 
Your head and your fine eyes are amazingly like him , for we were often together before he set out for 
Troy , where the bravest of the 
Argives sailed in their hollow ships . but I have never seen 
Odysseus since that day , nor he me . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered : �I will speak honestly . 
My mother says I am his son , but I do not know , for none can be certain of his own parentage . if only I had been the son of some lucky man who spent old age among his own possessions ! as it is , 
they say , since you ask , that I am born of the unluckiest of mortal men . � / 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , 
replied : �Yet with 
Penelope for your mother the gods have ensured your line will not be unknown . but tell me , in truth , what is this feast , these folk ? 
Why is this needed ? Is it a banquet or a wedding celebration ? It�s clearly not one where each brings his own provisions , since imperiously , insolently , 
they feast in your house . 
Any man of sense who mixed with them would be angered at the sight of these shameful actions . � / 
Then wise 
Telemachus answered : �Stranger , since you ask the question , our house once seemed made for wealth and honour , when 
Odysseus was with his people . but the gods have willed otherwise since then , with their dark designs , for unlike other men 
they have made him vanish . if he had been killed among his friends at 
Troy , or died in the arms of friends with the war ended , his death itself would grieve me less . 
Then the 
Achaean host would have built his tomb , and he would have won a fine name for his son to inherit . in fact the harpies have snatched him , without trace : he is beyond sight and hearing , and leaves me in sorrow and tears : nor do I sigh and groan for him alone , for the gods have granted me other painful troubles . 
All the princes who rule the islands , 
Dulichium , 
Same , and wooded 
Zacynthus , and all the lords of rocky Ithaca court my mother and consume my wealth with their feasts : soon 
they will destroy me , too . � / 
Moved to anger , 
Pallas 
Athene spoke : �Ah , you have dire need of lost 
Odysseus , to set hands on these shameless 
Suitors . if only he were standing at the palace gates now , with his helmet and shield and twin spears , just as when I first saw him at my house , drinking joyously , on his way home from 
Ephyre , after his visit to Ilus , Mermerus� son . 
Odysseus went there as well , in his swift ship , in search of a deadly poison to smear on the tips of his bronze-headed arrows . Ilus was in awe of the deathless gods and refused him , but my father who loved him dearly did not . if only 
Odysseus , I say , as he was , 
could confront the 
Suitors : 
they would meet death swiftly , and a dark wedding . but , indeed , it lies in the lap of the gods whether he will return and take vengeance in his palace , or not : but I urge you yourself to plan how to drive these 
Suitors from the house . / 
Come , listen , and note my words . 
Call the 
Achaean lords together tomorrow : speak to them all , with the gods for witness . tell the 
Suitors to disperse , each to his home : and if your mother�s heart urges her to marry , let her go back to her great father�s house , where 
they will ready a wedding feast , and a wealth of gifts , fitting for a well-beloved daughter . 
And I will give you good advice , if you will hear me . man the best ship you have with twenty oarsmen , go and seek news of your absent father . Some mortal may tell you , or perhaps a rumour sent by 
Zeus to bring news to men . Go to 
Pylos first , and question the noble 
Nestor : then to Sparta to yellow-haired 
Menelaus , last of the bronze-clad 
Achaeans to reach home . if you hear your father is living , and sailing home , then however troubled you are , endure for another year . but if you hear he is dead , return to your own land , build a mound , with all the funeral rites , generous ones as is fitting , and give your mother away to a new husband . When you have settled and done all this , use heart and mind to plan how to kill the 
Suitors in your palace , openly or by guile : since it is not right for you to follow childish ways , being no more a child . Perhaps you have not heard what fame 
Orestes won among men , destroying his father�s murderer , cunning 
Aegisthus , for killing his noble father ? 
You too take courage , my friend , since I see you are tall and fine , so that many a man unborn will praise you . but now I must go to my swift ship , and my crew who will be weary of waiting . 
Take note yourself of my words , and consider them . / 
Wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Stranger , truly , you speak kindly like a father to his son , and I will never forget your words . but stay a while , though you are eager to be gone , so that when you have bathed and eased your heart , you can go to your ship in good spirits , taking a rich and beautiful gift from me as a keepsake , such as stranger gives to stranger in friendship . � 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , answered him : �Do not detain me longer , since I am eager to go , but whatever gift your heart prompts you to send home with me , give it to me when I return , choosing one of the loveliest , and it will bring you good value in exchange . � / 
So the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , spoke , and vanished , soaring upwards like a bird . in his heart she had stirred fortitude and daring , and made him think of his father even more . 
He felt what had passed in his spirit , and was awed , realising a god had been with him , and godlike himself he at once rejoined the 
Suitors . / as 
they sat listening in silence , the famous minstrel sang to them of the Achaeans� troubled return from 
Troy , inflicted by 
Pallas 
Athene . 
Wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , heard his marvellous song from her chamber , and descended the stairs , accompanied by her two maids . as she neared the 
Suitors she drew her shining veil across her face , and stopped by the doorpost of the well-made hall , a loyal handmaid on either side . 
Then , with tear-filled eyes , she spoke to the divine bard : / �Phemius , you know many another tale of men and gods , that the bards made famous , with which to charm us mortals . 
Sing one of those while you sit here , as 
they drink their wine in silence , but end this sad song that always troubles the heart in my breast , since above all women I bear a sadness not to be forgotten . I ever remember my husband�s dear face , he whose fame resounds through Hellas to the heart of 
Argos . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered her : �Mother , why grudge the good bard his right to please us as the spirit stirs him ? Bards are not to blame , surely : it is 
Zeus we must blame , who deals with each eater of bread as he wishes . No one can be angry if this man sings the Danaans� dark fate : since men always praise the most the newest song 
they hear . 
Suffer you heart and mind to listen , for 
Odysseus was not alone in failing to return from 
Troy , many another perished too . 
So go to your quarters now , and attend to your own duties at loom and spindle , and order your maids about their tasks : let men worry about such things , and I especially , since I hold the authority in this house . � / 
Seized with wonder she retired to her own room , taking her son�s wise words to heart . 
Up to her high chamber she went , accompanied by her maids , and there she wept for 
Odysseus , her dear husband , till bright-eyed 
Athene 
veiled her eyelids with sweet sleep . / but throughout the shadowy hall the 
Suitors created uproar , with each man praying he might bed her . 
Wise 
Telemachus was then the first to speak : �My mother�s 
Suitors , proud in your insolence , let us enjoy the feast for now , but without disturbance , since it is a lovely thing to listen to such a bard as this , with his godlike voice . 
Then , in the morning , let us take our seats in the assembly , so I can declare to you all you must leave the palace . Feast elsewhere , move from house to house , and eat your own provisions . if it seems preferable , more profitable to you , to waste one man�s estate without restitution , then do so , but I meanwhile will call on the eternal gods hoping that 
Zeus might grant a day of reckoning . 
Then you will be wasted in my halls , without restitution . � / 
So he spoke , and 
they bit their lips , amazed at Telemachus� bold speech . 
Then 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , 
replied : �Telemachus , the gods themselves must have taught you this bold , high style . 
May the son of 
Cronos never make you king of Ithaca�s isle , though it is your heritage by birth . � / 
Then wise 
Telemachus answered him : �Will it anger you , 
Antinous , if I say that I should be pleased to accept it from Zeus� hand . do you think , in truth , it is the worst fate for a man ? 
It is no bad thing to be a king . At once your house grows rich , and you are held in higher honour . but there are many other kings for the 
Achaeans , young and old , in Ithaca�s isle . Perhaps one of them will have the honour , since noble 
Odysseus is dead . but I will be master of my own house , and of the servants noble 
Odysseus gathered for me . � / 
Then 
Eurymachus , Polybus� son , 
replied : �Surely , 
Telemachus , the question of who will be king , in Ithaca�s isle , is in the lap of the gods : and as for your possessions , keep them , and be master in your own house . 
While men live in Ithaca , let no man come and snatch your possessions from you , violently , or against your will . but I am prompted to ask , dear sir , where has that stranger come from ? 
What country does he claim as his ? 
Where are his kin , and native land ? 
Does he bring news of your father�s arrival , or did he come here on his own account ? 
How he leapt up and vanished ! 
He would not wait to be known , though he seemed no common man . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus answered him , saying : �Eurymachus , surely my father has lost his chance to return . I no longer put my faith in rumours , wherever 
they come from , nor do I note the prophecies my mother may hear , from some diviner she has called to the palace . 
The stranger is a friend of my father�s from 
Taphos . 
He announced he is mentes , the son of wise 
Anchialus , lord of the sea-going 
Taphians . � / 
So 
Telemachus spoke , yet in his heart he knew it was the deathless goddess . / 
Now 
they turned to dancing , heart-felt song , and enjoyment , till nightfall . 
Then each went to his house to rest . but 
Telemachus went to his bed with his mind full of thoughts , to his room high above the fine courtyard , with its clear view : and faithful 
Eurycleia , daughter of 
Ops , Peisenor�s son , carrying a blazing torch , waited on him . 
Laertes had bought her himself long ago , when she was still quite young , at the cost of twenty oxen , and honoured her in his palace as he honoured his loyal wife , never lying with her for fear of his wife�s anger . 
Now she carried the blazing torches for 
Telemachus , since of all the women it was she who loved him most , having nursed him as a child . 
He opened the door to the well-made room , and sitting on the bed took off his soft tunic , and placed it in the wise old woman�s hands . 
Folding and smoothing the tunic , she hung it on a peg by the wooden bedstead , and went out of the room , closing the door by its silver handle , shooting the bolt by means of its leather thong . 
There , all night long , wrapped in a woollen fleece , 
Telemachus planned in his mind the journey 
Athene proposed . /
