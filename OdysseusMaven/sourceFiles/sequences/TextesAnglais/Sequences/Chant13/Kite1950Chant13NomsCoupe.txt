
Odysseus finished speaking . 
Spellbound at his words , all had fallen silent in the darkened hall . 
Then 
Alcinous addressed him once more , saying : �Odysseus , now you have set foot on the bronze floor of my high hall , I suspect , though you have suffered greatly , you will not be driven back on your course again as you sail home . 
Now I give this command to every man who drinks the Elders� glowing wine and listens to the bard . 
Clothing , and finely wrought gold , and all the other gifts the 
Phaeacian counsellors brought here for our guest are already laid up in the polished chest . but now let each offer him a cauldron and a large tripod . We in turn will impose a levy on the people to recoup the cost , since it would be hard on any man to give so generously without repayment . � / Alcinous� words pleased them , and each man went to his house to sleep , but when rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared 
they hastened to bring the articles of bronze that add to a man�s power , to the ship . 
And royal 
Alcinous himself went up and down the deck , stowing them carefully under the benches , so 
they would not hamper the crew when rowing , as 
they sweated at the oars . 
Then 
they went to 
Alcinous� halls to ready a feast , and Alcinous sacrificed a bull on their behalf to 
Zeus , the lord of all , the god of the dark clouds , Cronos� son . / 
When 
they had burned the pieces of thigh , 
they made a fine and joyful feast , and the divine bard 
Demodocus , honoured by the people , sang to the sound of his lyre . but 
Odysseus kept turning his head to see the shining sun , impatient for its setting , more than eager to be on his way . 
He was as glad to see the light vanish as a ploughman , longing for his supper , whose team of black oxen has pulled the share through unturned soil all day , and whose legs are weary as he goes home to his meal . 
Then he addressed the 
Phaeacians , lovers of the sea , 
Alcinous above all : �Lord 
Alcinous , famous above all men , and all you other noblemen , pour your libations now , and send me on my way in peace . 
And farewell , to you all ! 
Now everything I could wish has been achieved : a ship to take me home , and friendly gifts . 
May the gods in heaven bless them both , and when I reach home let me find my faultless wife and my loved ones safe , and may you I leave behind bring joy to your wives and children , and may the gods grant you every excellence , and may no evil come to your people . � / 
They all praised his words , and 
urged the departure of this guest who spoke so eloquently . 
Then 
mighty 
Alcinous called to his 
herald , saying : �Mix the wine , Pontonous , and serve it through the hall , so that once we have prayed to 
Father 
Zeus we can send our guest on his way to his own country . � / At this , Pontonous mixed the honey-sweet wine , and served them all in turn , and 
they poured libations , where 
they sat , to the gods who are blessed and rule the wide heavens . 
Then noble 
Odysseus rose to his feet , and placed his two-handled cup in Arete�s hands , and addressed her with winged words : �Fare well through all the years , 
Queen , till our mortal fate , old-age and death , shall come . I go my way , now , but may you take joy in your children , your people , and 
Alcinous , your king . � / 
So spoke noble 
Odysseus , and crossed the threshold . 
And 
mighty 
Alcinous sent a 
herald with him to lead the way to the swift ship and the shore . 
And 
Arete sent a serving-woman to carry a fresh tunic and cloak , and another in charge of the stout chest , and another with bread and red wine . / as soon as 
they reached the ship and the sea , the noble youths who escorted him stowed everything in the hollow ship , down to the food and drink . 
Then 
they spread a rug with a linen sheet on deck , at the stern of the hollow ship , so he could sleep sound , and he went on board and quietly lay down . 
They sat to their benches , each in his place , and the hawser was loosed from the stone mooring ring , and as soon as 
they leant into the stroke and struck the brine with their blades sweet sleep fell over his eyelids , a deep sweet sleep like death . / 
Like a team of stallions , a four in hand , that leap forward together over the plain at the lash of a whip , and with heads held high forge their way , so the ship�s stern leapt in the water , and the glittering wave of the breaking sea foamed violently in her wake . 
Safe and sure she sped on her way , and not even the wheeling falcon , the swiftest winged creature , could have caught her . 
So she cut quickly through the waves , carrying a man wise as the gods , who had suffered many heartfelt sorrows in war and on the surging waves , but now he slept , at peace , his mind empty of all his troubles . / 
And now , as the brightest planet rose , the first to 
herald dawn�s early light , the sea-going vessel approached 
Ithaca . / 
One of the island�s coves is that of 
Phorcys , the 
Old man of the 
Sea , with its mouth between two projecting headlands : both are sheer cliffs to seaward , but slope down towards the harbour on the landward side . 
They restrain the huge breakers raised by strong winds outside , while oared ships can ride unmoored once 
they have reached their anchorage . a long-leafed olive tree grows at the head of the cove , and nearby is a pleasant , shadowy cave sacred to the 
Nymphs called Naiads . 
There are stone mixing-bowls and jars inside , where the bees have their hives . 
And there are great stone looms in the cave , on which the 
Nymphs weave wondrous purple fabrics , and also there are never-failing springs . 
The cave has two mouths , one facing the 
North 
Wind by which men enter , while the other facing the 
South 
Wind is the immortal gods� sacred portal that men do not use . / 
The 
Phaeacians landed here , knowing the place , and the ship , driven by the muscles of her crew , was running so fast in her swift passage that she beached by half her length . 
They leapt on shore from the oared vessel , and began by lifting 
Odysseus from the deck , glossy rug , linen sheet and all , and laying him down on the sand , still fast asleep . 
Then 
they lifted out all the gifts that the noble 
Phaeacians , prompted by great-hearted 
Athene , had sent with 
Odysseus . 
These 
they stacked by the trunk of an olive-tree , away from the path , in case some passer-by found them and stole them before he woke . 
Then 
they turned for home . / but the 
Earth-Shaker had not forgotten his past threats against godlike 
Odysseus , and he asked what 
Zeus intended : �I , even I , 
Father 
Zeus , will no longer be honoured by the deathless gods , since mortals honour me not at all , 
Phaeacians too who , as you well know , are descended from me . I said not long ago that 
Odysseus should suffer before he reached home , though I never denied he might return once you promised it and confirmed so with a nod . but these men have carried him over the sea in their swift ship , and set him down on 
Ithaca , and given him countless gifts , gold and bronze and woven fabrics , even more than he would have brought from 
Troy if he had returned directly with his due share of the spoils . � / 
Cloud-Gatherer 
Zeus 
replied : �Oh , what a thing to say , my powerful 
Earth-Shaker ! 
The gods never fail to honour you : it would be a wretched thing indeed to lack respect for the oldest and the greatest . but if any man , intoxicated by his strength and power , fails to honour you in any way you are free to take your revenge hereafter . do what you wish , and as it pleases you . � / 
Then 
Poseidon , the 
Earth-Shaker , answered him : �God of the dark clouds , I would have done as you say already , but I dreaded and sought to avoid your anger , as ever . 
Now though , I intend to strike the 
Phaeacians fine ship as she returns from her voyage on the misty deep , to warn them to stop transporting strangers . 
And I�ll ring their 
city with a vast mountain chain . � / �Dear 
brother , listen to what I think is best , � 
Cloud-Gatherer 
Zeus 
replied . �Wait till all the eyes of the 
city are on her as she sails swiftly to port and turn her to stone close to shore , a reef in the shape of a passing ship , so all of them are amazed , then ring their 
city with that vast mountain chain . � / 
When 
Poseidon , 
Earth-Shaker , heard this , he headed for the 
Phaeacian land of 
Scheria , and waited as the sailing ship , speeding swiftly on her course , neared the shore . 
Then the 
Earth-Shaker approached and with one blow from the flat of his hand turned her to stone , and rooted her in place . 
Then he was gone . 
The 
Phaeacians , those men of the long oars famed for their seafaring , spoke with winged words to each other , each man glancing at his neighbour , saying : �Oh , who has fixed our swift ship in the sea as she was sailing home , in plain sight of us as well ! � 
They spoke about it , but failed to comprehend it , until 
Alcinous addressed them : �Ah , it is my father�s prophecy of long ago , returned in truth to haunt us . 
He said that 
Poseidon was angry with us because we transported strangers in safety , and that one day he would strike one of our fine ships as she returned from her voyage over the misty deep , and he would ring our 
city with a vast mountain chain . 
So my aged father said , and now it has all come true . 
Now hear what I command . No longer give transport to our city�s guests , and let us sacrifice twelve choice bulls to 
Poseidon . 
He may take pity on us , and not ring our 
city with a great mountain range . � / 
They were gripped by fear , at his words , and swiftly readied the beasts . 
There all the counsellors and leaders of the 
Phaeacians stood , close to the altar , praying to lord 
Poseidon . Meanwhile in his own country 
Odysseus woke , and after his long absence failed to recognise where he was . for the goddess 
Pallas 
Athene , Zeus� daughter , had veiled him in mist , so she might make him seem like a stranger , and be his guide , while his wife , his neighbours and his friends still knew him not , till the 
Suitors had paid the price of their crimes . 
So everything looked strange to their king , those long ridge-tracks , the safe anchorages , the sheer cliffs and verdant trees . / 
He leapt to his feet , and stood staring about him at his native land . 
Then he struck both thighs with the flat of his hands and groaned aloud , speaking sadly to himself : �Alas , what mortal country have I reached ? are 
they lawless , cruel , uncivilised people here , or are 
they kind to strangers , minds fearful of the gods ? 
Shall I carry these riches with me , or merely explore ? I wished I had stayed with the 
Phaeacians , and then travelled on to some other great king�s palace , where I might have been a guest , then been helped on my homeward path . 
Now where can I hide this wealth of things ? if I leave it here it will be lost as spoil to others . oh , those 
Phaeacian counsellors and leaders were not quite so wise and just as 
they seemed . 
They said 
they would take me to clear-skied 
Ithaca , but 
they lied and brought me here to this strange land . 
May 
Zeus , the god of suppliants , who watches over us all and punishes transgressors punish them . but I had best check my goods now and tally them , in case 
they carried some off in their hollow ship . � / 
With this he began checking the fine tripods , the cauldrons , the gold and the lovely woven fabrics , and found nothing missing : then he dragged himself along beside the sounding waves , groaning deeply , longing for his native land . 
Soon 
Athene appeared , disguised as a young shepherd , yet as refined as a prince�s son . a fine cloak hung in a double fold from her shoulders , and she wore shining sandals on her feet , and held a spear in her hand . 
She was a welcome sight to 
Odysseus and he approached her and spoke with winged words : �Hail to you , 
Friend , the first person I have come across , and I hope you have no malicious intent against me , but will help protect me and this treasure , since I beg you as I would a god , and kneel at your knees in friendship . tell me clearly so I can be certain what country this is , what race , what kind of men live here . Is this some offshore 
island or a fertile headland sloping to the sea ? � / 
The goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , 
replied : �Stranger , you must be from some far-off place , or else be stupid , if you have to ask its name . 
It is by no means unknown . 
Many have heard of it , many of those who live toward the rising sun , and those who live toward the dark of evening . 
It is a rugged place , yes , unfit for herding horses yet narrow as it is , not destitute . 
It carries crops in plenty and good vineyards too , and it never lacks copious dew and rain . a fine land it is for grazing goats and cattle as well , with every kind of tree , and never-failing springs . 
So Ithaca�s name has spread even as far as 
Troy , 
Stranger , and 
they say that is a long way from our Achaea . � / noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was overjoyed at her words , delighting in being back on his native soil , and he answered 
Pallas 
Athene , daughter of aegis-bearing 
Zeus , with winged words . but he concealed the truth , smothering certain words before 
they were spoken , choosing what he said artfully . / �Even in spacious 
Crete , over the water , I heard of 
Ithaca , and now I have brought myself and my wealth here . as much again I left behind with my children , fleeing that land after killing Orsilochus the swift-footed , the brave son of Idomeneus . in spacious 
Crete he could run faster than any other eater of bread . 
He it was who tried to steal those hard-won spoils from 
Troy I suffered for , enduring the wars of men and the wretched waves , simply because I would not obey his father , and serve under him at 
Troy , but led my own company there . 
So I lay in wait for him by the roadway with one of my men , and struck him with a bronze spear as he returned from the fields . 
Dark night veiled the sky , and no one saw us , so I took his life in secret . 
Then , having killed him , I made for a 
Phoenician ship , and giving them goods enough to satisfy them , I asked those lords of the sea to take me on board and land me at Pylos or lovely 
Elis , where the Epeians rule . / but the power of the winds sent them off course , against their will since 
they had no wish to cheat me and , driven from there , at night we reached this land . We rowed swiftly for the harbour , and not thinking of supper though we needed food , we all leapt ashore and lay there , just as we were . 
Then I slept out of weariness , but while I was asleep 
they brought my goods from the hollow ship and set them down on the sand where I lay . 
Then 
they embarked and sailed for the thriving port of 
Sidon , leaving me here , troubled at heart . � / 
The goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , smiled at his words , and touching him with her hand altered her form as she did so to that of a tall and lovely woman , accomplished in every glorious art . 
And she addressed him with winged words : �Even if a god encountered you he would need to be wily and devious to outdo you in cunning . Resolute man , subtle in counsel , never 
tiring of intrigue , even in you own country you will always be full of guile and the lying tales you love so much . but let us talk of other things . We are well-matched in these arts , you being the most eloquent and practical of men , and I known among the gods for my wisdom and subtlety . 
Still you failed to know me , 
Pallas 
Athene , Zeus� daughter : she who is ever by your side to protect you in all your adventures . 
It was I who made the 
Phaeacians kind to you . 
And once again I�m here to help you plan ahead , and before you start for home to hide the treasure the noble 
Phaeacians gave you since I wanted it so and prompted them , and to tell you all the tale of woe you are fated to enact in your fine palace . Be strong , for you must bear it . tell no one , man or woman , that it is you , back from your wanderings , but suffer your troubles in silence , and endure the insults some will offer . � / 
Then wily 
Odysseus 
replied : �Goddess , it is hard for a man to recognise you when he meets you no matter how clever he is , since you take what shape you will . but this I do know , you were kind to me , back then when we 
Achaeans fought on the plains of 
Troy , but once we�d sacked the high citadel of 
Priam and our ships had sailed away , only to be scattered by a god , I never saw you again , Zeus� daughter : I never caught sight of you there , on the deck of my vessel , helping to shield me from danger . No , I had to travel on , heart labouring in my breast , till the gods rescued me from trouble . 
Only there in the comfortable land of the 
Phaeacians did you appear , it�s true , to encourage me with words , and lead me to their 
city . 
Still , I ask you now in your Father�s name to tell me � since no , I don�t believe I�ve reached clear-skied 
Ithaca , and this is some foreign land I travel , and you are making mock of me trying to confuse my mind � tell me whether I�m truly back in my own country . � / �That�s the way you always think , � bright-eyed 
Athene 
replied , �that must be why I don�t abandon you to your sorrows : you are always so courteous , so intelligent , and so cautious ! 
Any other man back from his wanderings would have rushed to his palace to see his wife and children , but you don�t care to know a thing until you�ve tested your wife further . 
She is still there in the palace , weeping , while the sad days and nights wane . as for me , I knew beyond doubt you would reach home , losing all companions . but know this . I was not prepared to fight my own uncle 
Poseidon , whose heart was filled with anger when you blinded his son . 
Come then , I�ll show you the 
island of 
Ithaca , so you will know . 
There is the harbour of 
Phorcys , the 
Old man of the 
Sea , and there at its head is the long-leaved olive tree , with that lovely shadowy cave nearby , sacred to the 
Nymphs 
they call the Naiads . 
That indeed is the echoing cavern where you once offered the 
Nymphs many fine sacrifices , and over there is 
Mount 
Neriton , clothed in forest . � / 
With this the goddess dispersed the mist , and revealed the 
island . noble , long-suffering 
Odysseus was overjoyed , delighted to see his own country , and he kissed the fertile ground . 
Then he prayed swiftly with outstretched arms , to the 
Nymphs : �Naiads , daughters of 
Zeus , I never thought to see all this again , but I greet you now with loving prayer . 
And I will offer gifts , as before , if this daughter of 
Zeus , who guides armies , will let me live and help my brave son reach manhood . � / 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , answered him in turn : �Be reassured , let nothing trouble your heart . We must go now and pile your goods in the innermost angle of the cave , where 
they can stay secure . 
And let�s think how to make certain everything turns out for the best . � / 
With this the goddess entered the shadowy cave , and searched for its hidden angles , while 
Odysseus carried all his goods inside , the gold the enduring bronze , and the finely woven clothes the 
Phaeacians had given him . 
He hid them away carefully , and 
Pallas 
Athene , daughter of aegis-bearing 
Zeus , closed the cave-mouth with a rock . / 
Then 
they both sat down by the trunk of the sacred olive-tree to plan the insolent Suitors� deaths . Bright-eyed 
Athene was first to speak : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , think about how you can come to grips with those shameless 
Suitors , who have been lording it in your halls for three whole years , paying court to your goddess of a wife , and offering marriage-gifts . 
She , while she longs for your return , never fails to nurse their hopes , and send each of them promising messages , her mind elsewhere . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �Oh , goddess , if you had not revealed all this clearly to me , I might have met the same evil fate in my palace , as 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son , did in his . 
Come now , weave some plot by which I might repay them , and be with me , and fill me with indomitable courage , as you did when we loosed Troy�s shining crown . if you with your glittering eyes are with me , inspiring me as you did then , helping me with a ready heart , you and I , great goddess , could tackle three hundred men . � / 
The goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , answered : �Of course I will be with you . I shall not forget you in the thick of the action , and I think more than one of those 
Suitors who swallow your possessions will stain the wide earth with his blood and brains . but come now , and I will make you unrecognisable to them all . I will wrinkle the smooth skin on your supple limbs , and thin the fine hair on your scalp , and clothe you in rags to make a man shudder . 
And I will dim the beauty of your eyes , till you seem repulsive to all the 
Suitors , and to the wife and son you left behind . 
Then go first and find the swineherd , who may be only a keeper of your pigs but feels well-disposed towards you , and loves your son and loyal 
Penelope . 
You will find him with the swine that feed their rich flesh by Raven�s 
Crag , near the spring of 
Arethusa , eating their fill of fattening acorns , and drinking the clear black water . Sit with him , there , 
Odysseus , and question him fully , while I go to 
Sparta , the country of lovely women , to summon your brave son Telemachus who journeyed to wide 
Lacedaemon , to the palace of 
Menelaus , to seek any news of your being still alive . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �Why did you not inform him , then , you whose mind is all-knowing ? 
Did you want him too to suffer dangers , wandering the restless waves while others consumed his inheritance ? � / 
Then 
Athene , of the flashing eyes , answered : �Don�t trouble your heart too greatly over him . I guided him , so he would win fame for travelling there , and he has no problems , sitting at ease in Menelaus� palace , with all the luxuries he needs before him . 
Yes , those young men in their black ship wait to ambush him , keen to murder him before he reaches home , but that will not happen I think . 
The earth will close over those 
Suitors who steal your possessions , long before then . � / 
So saying , 
Athene touched him with her wand . 
She wrinkled the smooth skin on his supple limbs , and thinned the fine hair on his scalp , and gave him the body of an old man . 
She dimmed the beauty of his eyes , and dressed him differently , in a wretched cloak and ragged tunic , of tattered filthy smoke-grimed cloth . 
Then she flung a large deerskin , devoid of hair , over his shoulders , and handed him a staff , and a sorry-looking leather pouch , punctured here and there , hanging from a piece of braided cord . / 
When the two of them had made their mutual plans , 
they parted : and the goddess left for glorious 
Lacedaemon , to bring back 
Odysseus� son . / Odysseus finished speaking . 
Spellbound at his words , all had fallen silent in the darkened hall . 
Then 
Alcinous addressed him once more , saying : �Odysseus , now you have set foot on the bronze floor of my high hall , I suspect , though you have suffered greatly , you will not be driven back on your course again as you sail home . 
Now I give this command to every man who drinks the Elders� glowing wine and listens to the bard . 
Clothing , and finely wrought gold , and all the other gifts the 
Phaeacian counsellors brought here for our guest are already laid up in the polished chest . but now let each offer him a cauldron and a large tripod . We in turn will impose a levy on the people to recoup the cost , since it would be hard on any man to give so generously without repayment . � / Alcinous� words pleased them , and each man went to his house to sleep , but when rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared 
they hastened to bring the articles of bronze that add to a man�s power , to the ship . 
And royal 
Alcinous himself went up and down the deck , stowing them carefully under the benches , so 
they would not hamper the crew when rowing , as 
they sweated at the oars . 
Then 
they went to 
Alcinous� halls to ready a feast , and Alcinous sacrificed a bull on their behalf to 
Zeus , the lord of all , the god of the dark clouds , Cronos� son . / 
When 
they had burned the pieces of thigh , 
they made a fine and joyful feast , and the divine bard 
Demodocus , honoured by the people , sang to the sound of his lyre . but 
Odysseus kept turning his head to see the shining sun , impatient for its setting , more than eager to be on his way . 
He was as glad to see the light vanish as a ploughman , longing for his supper , whose team of black oxen has pulled the share through unturned soil all day , and whose legs are weary as he goes home to his meal .

Odysseus , and crossed the threshold . 
And

city with a vast mountain chain . � / �Dear 
brother , listen to what I think is best , � 
Cloud-Gatherer 
Zeus 
replied . �Wait till all the eyes of the 
city are on her as she sails swiftly to port and turn her to stone close to shore , a reef in the shape of a passing ship , so all of them are amazed , then ring their 
city with that vast mountain chain . � / 
When 
Poseidon , 
Earth-Shaker , heard this , he headed for the 
Phaeacian land of 
Scheria , and waited as the sailing ship , speeding swiftly on her course , neared the shore . 
Then the 
Earth-Shaker approached and with one blow from the flat of his hand turned her to stone , and rooted her in place . 
Then he was gone . 
The 
Phaeacians , those men of the long oars famed for their seafaring , spoke with winged words to each other , each man glancing at his neighbour , saying : �Oh , who has fixed our swift ship in the sea as she was sailing home , in plain sight of us as well ! � 
They spoke about it , but failed to comprehend it , until 
Alcinous addressed them : �Ah , it is my father�s prophecy of long ago , returned in truth to haunt us . 
He said that 
Poseidon was angry with us because we transported strangers in safety , and that one day he would strike one of our fine ships as she returned from her voyage over the misty deep , and he would ring our 
city with a vast mountain chain . 
So my aged father said , and now it has all come true . 
Now hear what I command . No longer give transport to our city�s guests , and let us sacrifice twelve choice bulls to 
Poseidon . 
He may take pity on us , and not ring our 
city with a great mountain range . � / 
They were gripped by fear , at his words , and swiftly readied the beasts . 
There all the counsellors and leaders of the 
Phaeacians stood , close to the altar , praying to lord 
Poseidon . Meanwhile in his own country 
Odysseus woke , and after his long absence failed to recognise where he was . for the goddess 
Pallas 
Athene , Zeus� daughter , had veiled him in mist , so she might make him seem like a stranger , and be his guide , while his wife , his neighbours and his friends still knew him not , till the 
Suitors had paid the price of their crimes . 
So everything looked strange to their king , those long ridge-tracks , the safe anchorages , the sheer cliffs and verdant trees . / 
He leapt to his feet , and stood staring about him at his native land . 
Then he struck both thighs with the flat of his hands and groaned aloud , speaking sadly to himself : �Alas , what mortal country have I reached ? are 
they lawless , cruel , uncivilised people here , or are 
they kind to strangers , minds fearful of the gods ? 
Shall I carry these riches with me , or merely explore ? I wished I had stayed with the 
Phaeacians , and then travelled on to some other great king�s palace , where I might have been a guest , then been helped on my homeward path . 
Now where can I hide this wealth of things ? if I leave it here it will be lost as spoil to others . oh , those 
Phaeacian counsellors and leaders were not quite so wise and just as 
they seemed . 
They said 
they would take me to clear-skied 
Ithaca , but 
they lied and brought me here to this strange land . 
May 
Zeus , the god of suppliants , who watches over us all and punishes transgressors punish them . but I had best check my goods now and tally them , in case 
they carried some off in their hollow ship . � / 
With this he began checking the fine tripods , the cauldrons , the gold and the lovely woven fabrics , and found nothing missing : then he dragged himself along beside the sounding waves , groaning deeply , longing for his native land . 
Soon 
Athene appeared , disguised as a young shepherd , yet as refined as a prince�s son . a fine cloak hung in a double fold from her shoulders , and she wore shining sandals on her feet , and held a spear in her hand . 
She was a welcome sight to 
Odysseus and he approached her and spoke with winged words : �Hail to you , 
Friend , the first person I have come across , and I hope you have no malicious intent against me , but will help protect me and this treasure , since I beg you as I would a god , and kneel at your knees in friendship . tell me clearly so I can be certain what country this is , what race , what kind of men live here . Is this some offshore 
island or a fertile headland sloping to the sea ? � / 
The goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , 
replied : �Stranger , you must be from some far-off place , or else be stupid , if you have to ask its name . 
It is by no means unknown . 
Many have heard of it , many of those who live toward the rising sun , and those who live toward the dark of evening . 
It is a rugged place , yes , unfit for herding horses yet narrow as it is , not destitute . 
It carries crops in plenty and good vineyards too , and it never lacks copious dew and rain . a fine land it is for grazing goats and cattle as well , with every kind of tree , and never-failing springs . 
So Ithaca�s name has spread even as far as 
Troy , 
Stranger , and 
they say that is a long way from our Achaea . � / noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was overjoyed at her words , delighting in being back on his native soil , and he answered 
Pallas 
Athene , daughter of aegis-bearing 
Zeus , with winged words . but he concealed the truth , smothering certain words before 
they were spoken , choosing what he said artfully . / �Even in spacious 
Crete , over the water , I heard of 
Ithaca , and now I have brought myself and my wealth here . as much again I left behind with my children , fleeing that land after killing Orsilochus the swift-footed , the brave son of Idomeneus . in spacious 
Crete he could run faster than any other eater of bread . 
He it was who tried to steal those hard-won spoils from 
Troy I suffered for , enduring the wars of men and the wretched waves , simply because I would not obey his father , and serve under him at 
Troy , but led my own company there . 
So I lay in wait for him by the roadway with one of my men , and struck him with a bronze spear as he returned from the fields . 
Dark night veiled the sky , and no one saw us , so I took his life in secret . 
Then , having killed him , I made for a 
Phoenician ship , and giving them goods enough to satisfy them , I asked those lords of the sea to take me on board and land me at Pylos or lovely 
Elis , where the Epeians rule . / but the power of the winds sent them off course , against their will since 
they had no wish to cheat me and , driven from there , at night we reached this land . We rowed swiftly for the harbour , and not thinking of supper though we needed food , we all leapt ashore and lay there , just as we were . 
Then I slept out of weariness , but while I was asleep 
they brought my goods from the hollow ship and set them down on the sand where I lay . 
Then 
they embarked and sailed for the thriving port of 
Sidon , leaving me here , troubled at heart . � / 
The goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , smiled at his words , and touching him with her hand altered her form as she did so to that of a tall and lovely woman , accomplished in every glorious art . 
And she addressed him with winged words : �Even if a god encountered you he would need to be wily and devious to outdo you in cunning . Resolute man , subtle in counsel , never 
tiring of intrigue , even in you own country you will always be full of guile and the lying tales you love so much . but let us talk of other things . We are well-matched in these arts , you being the most eloquent and practical of men , and I known among the gods for my wisdom and subtlety . 
Still you failed to know me , 
Pallas 
Athene , Zeus� daughter : she who is ever by your side to protect you in all your adventures . 
It was I who made the 
Phaeacians kind to you . 
And once again I�m here to help you plan ahead , and before you start for home to hide the treasure the noble 
Phaeacians gave you since I wanted it so and prompted them , and to tell you all the tale of woe you are fated to enact in your fine palace . Be strong , for you must bear it . tell no one , man or woman , that it is you , back from your wanderings , but suffer your troubles in silence , and endure the insults some will offer . � / 
Then wily 
Odysseus 
replied : �Goddess , it is hard for a man to recognise you when he meets you no matter how clever he is , since you take what shape you will . but this I do know , you were kind to me , back then when we 
Achaeans fought on the plains of 
Troy , but once we�d sacked the high citadel of 
Priam and our ships had sailed away , only to be scattered by a god , I never saw you again , Zeus� daughter : I never caught sight of you there , on the deck of my vessel , helping to shield me from danger . No , I had to travel on , heart labouring in my breast , till the gods rescued me from trouble . 
Only there in the comfortable land of the 
Phaeacians did you appear , it�s true , to encourage me with words , and lead me to their 
city . 
Still , I ask you now in your Father�s name to tell me � since no , I don�t believe I�ve reached clear-skied 
Ithaca , and this is some foreign land I travel , and you are making mock of me trying to confuse my mind � tell me whether I�m truly back in my own country . � / �That�s the way you always think , � bright-eyed 
Athene 
replied , �that must be why I don�t abandon you to your sorrows : you are always so courteous , so intelligent , and so cautious ! 
Any other man back from his wanderings would have rushed to his palace to see his wife and children , but you don�t care to know a thing until you�ve tested your wife further . 
She is still there in the palace , weeping , while the sad days and nights wane . as for me , I knew beyond doubt you would reach home , losing all companions . but know this . I was not prepared to fight my own uncle 
Poseidon , whose heart was filled with anger when you blinded his son . 
Come then , I�ll show you the 
island of 
Ithaca , so you will know . 
There is the harbour of 
Phorcys , the 
Old man of the 
Sea , and there at its head is the long-leaved olive tree , with that lovely shadowy cave nearby , sacred to the 
Nymphs 
they call the Naiads . 
That indeed is the echoing cavern where you once offered the 
Nymphs many fine sacrifices , and over there is 
Mount 
Neriton , clothed in forest . � / 
With this the goddess dispersed the mist , and revealed the 
island . noble , long-suffering 
Odysseus was overjoyed , delighted to see his own country , and he kissed the fertile ground . 
Then he prayed swiftly with outstretched arms , to the 
Nymphs : �Naiads , daughters of 
Zeus , I never thought to see all this again , but I greet you now with loving prayer . 
And I will offer gifts , as before , if this daughter of 
Zeus , who guides armies , will let me live and help my brave son reach manhood . � / 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , answered him in turn : �Be reassured , let nothing trouble your heart . We must go now and pile your goods in the innermost angle of the cave , where 
they can stay secure . 
And let�s think how to make certain everything turns out for the best . � / 
With this the goddess entered the shadowy cave , and searched for its hidden angles , while 
Odysseus carried all his goods inside , the gold the enduring bronze , and the finely woven clothes the 
Phaeacians had given him . 
He hid them away carefully , and 
Pallas 
Athene , daughter of aegis-bearing 
Zeus , closed the cave-mouth with a rock . / 
Then 
they both sat down by the trunk of the sacred olive-tree to plan the insolent Suitors� deaths . Bright-eyed 
Athene was first to speak : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , think about how you can come to grips with those shameless 
Suitors , who have been lording it in your halls for three whole years , paying court to your goddess of a wife , and offering marriage-gifts . 
She , while she longs for your return , never fails to nurse their hopes , and send each of them promising messages , her mind elsewhere . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �Oh , goddess , if you had not revealed all this clearly to me , I might have met the same evil fate in my palace , as 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son , did in his . 
Come now , weave some plot by which I might repay them , and be with me , and fill me with indomitable courage , as you did when we loosed Troy�s shining crown . if you with your glittering eyes are with me , inspiring me as you did then , helping me with a ready heart , you and I , great goddess , could tackle three hundred men . � / 
The goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , answered : �Of course I will be with you . I shall not forget you in the thick of the action , and I think more than one of those 
Suitors who swallow your possessions will stain the wide earth with his blood and brains . but come now , and I will make you unrecognisable to them all . I will wrinkle the smooth skin on your supple limbs , and thin the fine hair on your scalp , and clothe you in rags to make a man shudder . 
And I will dim the beauty of your eyes , till you seem repulsive to all the 
Suitors , and to the wife and son you left behind . 
Then go first and find the swineherd , who may be only a keeper of your pigs but feels well-disposed towards you , and loves your son and loyal 
Penelope . 
You will find him with the swine that feed their rich flesh by Raven�s 
Crag , near the spring of 
Arethusa , eating their fill of fattening acorns , and drinking the clear black water . Sit with him , there , 
Odysseus , and question him fully , while I go to 
Sparta , the country of lovely women , to summon your brave son Telemachus who journeyed to wide 
Lacedaemon , to the palace of 
Menelaus , to seek any news of your being still alive . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �Why did you not inform him , then , you whose mind is all-knowing ? 
Did you want him too to suffer dangers , wandering the restless waves while others consumed his inheritance ? � / 
Then 
Athene , of the flashing eyes , answered : �Don�t trouble your heart too greatly over him . I guided him , so he would win fame for travelling there , and he has no problems , sitting at ease in Menelaus� palace , with all the luxuries he needs before him . 
Yes , those young men in their black ship wait to ambush him , keen to murder him before he reaches home , but that will not happen I think . 
The earth will close over those 
Suitors who steal your possessions , long before then . � / 
So saying , 
Athene touched him with her wand . 
She wrinkled the smooth skin on his supple limbs , and thinned the fine hair on his scalp , and gave him the body of an old man . 
She dimmed the beauty of his eyes , and dressed him differently , in a wretched cloak and ragged tunic , of tattered filthy smoke-grimed cloth . 
Then she flung a large deerskin , devoid of hair , over his shoulders , and handed him a staff , and a sorry-looking leather pouch , punctured here and there , hanging from a piece of braided cord . / 
When the two of them had made their mutual plans , 
they parted : and the goddess left for glorious 
Lacedaemon , to bring back Odysseus� son . /
