
Meanwhile 
Pallas 
Athene sped to broad 
Lacedaemon to remind great-hearted Odysseus� noble son that it was time to head for home , and to hurry his departure . 
She found 
Telemachus and Peisistratus , Nestor�s noble son , in their beds in the porch of great Menelaus� palace . Nestor�s son was fast asleep , but sweet sleep eluded 
Telemachus , kept awake by anxious thoughts of his father , all that eternal night . Bright-eyed 
Athene stood by his bed , and spoke to him , saying : �Telemachus , it�s wrong to linger here far from home , leaving your wealth behind , with your house full of insolent men , lest 
they divide your goods and devour them , and your voyage proves worthless . 
Rouse 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry to send you on your way , instead , if you hope to find your peerless mother still in the palace . Her father and brothers are urging her to marry 
Eurymachus : he courts her with more and better gifts than the other 
Suitors . 
And have a care she doesn�t take a share of your wealth , despite your wishes . 
You know how women think : 
they want to add to a new husband�s glory , forgetting a faithful former partner once he�s dead , and no longer asking after their children by him . Go home , and put the best of your women servants in charge of your possessions , until the gods send you a worthy bride . / 
And here�s another thing for you to consider . The leading 
Suitors lie in wait for you , in the strait between Ithaca and rocky 
Samos , ready to kill you before you reach your native island . I think the earth will cover those who waste your wealth long before that day comes , but keep your fine ship far from the strait , and sail by night as well as by day , and that divine power that guards and protects you will send a following breeze . land at the first place you can on Ithaca , then send the ship and crew round to the harbour , but you yourself must find the swineherd who guards your pigs . 
He is well disposed towards you . 
Spend the night there , and send him to the 
city to tell wise 
Penelope you are back safely from 
Pylos . � / 
With this she left for the heights of Olympus , while 
Telemachus woke 
Nestor�s son from his sweet sleep with a nudge of his foot , and said : �Wake now , Peisistratus , son of Nestor , and harness your well-shod horses to the chariot , so we can be on our way . � / Peisitratus , waking , answered : �Telemachus , however eager you are we can�t drive in pitch darkness : dawn is not far off . Wait till 
Menelaus , the heroic spearman , Atreus� son , can bring his gifts and put them aboard the chariot , and send us on our way then with a kind farewell . a guest should always remember a host who shows him kindness . � / 
Soon golden-throned 
Dawn appeared , and 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry rose from where he slept , beside 
Helen of the lovely tresses , and approached them . 
When Odysseus� brave son , the hero , saw him he swiftly dressed in his shining tunic , flung a great cloak over his sturdy shoulders , and went to greet him , saying : �Menelaus , leader of men , son of 
Atreus , favoured of 
Zeus , send me on my way home , I am eager to return . � / 
And 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry said : �Telemachus , I�d never keep you here if you wish to leave , quite the opposite . I blame any host who yields or resists too much : moderation in all things . It�s as bad to hurry off a departing guest as to hold back one who�s anxious to go . 
One should give a warm welcome to the newcomer , and say a fond farewell to the man who�s leaving . 
Nevertheless , there�s time for me to load your chariot with fine gifts while you watch , and for me to have the servants find you a meal in the hall from all the plenty there . There�s a double benefit in a traveller feeding before he drives off into the wide open spaces , honour and glory to me , sustenance to you . if you want to see 
Hellas and central 
Argos , fine , I�ll travel with you , harness my horses and lead you to all the cities of men . They�ll not send us away empty-handed . They�ll give us some gift at least to take away , a solid bronze tripod or cauldron , a pair of mules , or a golden cup . � / �Menelaus , leader of men , son of 
Atreus , favoured of Zeus� , wise 
Telemachus replied , �I would rather go straight home , since I left no one in charge back there , and in seeking my godlike father I fear I may lose my own life , or some of my house�s valued treasures . � / 
When 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry heard this , he asked his wife to have her servants prepare a meal in the hall from the plenty there . Eteoneus , Boethous� son , who lived nearby and was fresh from his bed , arrived at that moment , and 
Menelaus asked him to light a fire , and roast some meat . 
He heard and obeyed , while 
Menelaus went off to his scented treasure room , taking 
Helen and Megapenthes with him . 
When 
they reached the store-house 
Menelaus chose a two-handled cup , and told his son Megapenthes to take a silver mixing-bowl , while 
Helen went to the chests holding richly-embroidered robes she had made herself . 
That most beautiful of women lifted out and 
carried off the largest and most beautifully worked of all . 
It had lain beneath the rest , and now glittered like a star . 
Then 
they walked back through the palace to 
Telemachus , and yellow-haired 
Menelaus spoke to him : / �Telemachus , may 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , Hera�s husband , grant you the homecoming you desire . The finest most precious of all the treasures in my store is the one I will give to you . This sweetly-made mixing bowl is solid silver rimmed with gold , and 
Hephaestus was its creator . 
Phaedimus the hero , the 
Sidonian 
King , gave it to me when his house sheltered me as I journeyed home , and now I give it to you . � / 
With this the heroic son of 
Atreus 
held out the two-handled cup to 
Telemachus , while mighty Megapenthes brought the silver mixing-bowl and placed it before him . 
Then 
Helen approached holding the robe , and addressed him : �Dear child , I too give you a gift to remember 
Helen by , made by her own hands , for your bride to wear when the longed-for wedding day arrives . let your dear mother keep it by her in the palace until then . as for yourself I wish you a joyful return to your own home and country . � 
Then she placed it in his hands , and he received it with pleasure . / Peisistratus , the hero , stowed the gifts in a chest inside the chariot , examining them admiringly . 
Then yellow-haired 
Menelaus led the way to the house , and 
they sat down on stools and chairs . a maid brought water in a fine golden jug so 
they could rinse their hands , pouring it over their hands into a silver basin . 
Then she brought a gleaming table , and the loyal housekeeper set bread and dishes of meat before them , giving freely of her stores . Eteoneus carved , and served the portions , and Megapenthes poured the wine . 
And 
they helped themselves to the meal . but once 
they had quenched hunger and thirst , 
Telemachus and Peisistratus harnessed the horses and mounting their inlaid chariot drove through the gate with its echoing portico . / The son of 
Atreus , yellow-haired 
Menelaus , followed , carrying a golden cup of honeyed wine in his right hand , so 
they could pour a final libation . standing beside the horses he pledged them , saying : �Farewell , youngsters , and greet 
Nestor , the shepherd of his people , for me . 
He was like a father to me when we 
Achaeans fought on the plains of 
Troy . � / �Rest assured we will do so , as soon as we arrive , favoured of 
Zeus . � said courteous 
Telemachus . �If only 
Odysseus were there at home in Ithaca too , and I returning to tell him of all the kindness I�ve met with at your hands while I was here , and of the many fine gifts I carry . � / as he was speaking an eagle flew over them to their right , gripping a large white goose in its talons , a tame bird snatched from the yard . 
Behind it men and women ran shouting , but the eagle still approached them and veered to the right in front of the horses , gladdening the hearts of those who saw it , and raising their spirits . Peisistratus , Nestor�s son , spoke first : �Menelaus , leader of men , favoured of 
Zeus , do you think the god sends this omen for you or for us ? � At this 
Menelaus took thought as to how the sign should be interpreted , but 
Helen of the long robe pre-empted his words , saying : �Listen and I will prophesy at the gods� prompting and as I am certain it will come to be . as the eagle flew from the mountain where he was born among his kin , and seized the goose bred for the table , so 
Odysseus will return to his house after much effort and wandering and take revenge : maybe he is there even now planning disaster for the 
Suitors . � / �May 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , Hera�s husband , make it so , � replied wise 
Telemachus , �and then when I�m there I�ll pray to you as a goddess . � / 
With this , 
Telemachus flicked his whip at the horses . 
They flew swiftly and eagerly through the town towards the plain , and all day long 
they strained at the yoke across their necks . / 
Now the sun dipped and the roads grew dark . 
And 
they came again to 
Pherae , to Diocles� house , Ortilochus� son whom 
Alpheius bore . 
There 
they passed the night , and he welcomed them , as strangers should be welcomed . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
they harnessed the horses , mounted the ornate chariot , and drove past the echoing portico out of the gate . 
Then 
Telemachus flicked the team with his whip to start them , and the willing pair flew onwards . 
Soon 
they reached the high citadel of 
Pylos , and turning to Peisistratus , he said : �Because of our father�s friendship we are friends , and we are of like age , and moreover this journey has united our hearts . 
Will you make me a promise , and execute it just as I say ? Favoured of 
Zeus , don�t drive on past my ship , but drop me off there , lest your father keeps me there at the palace against my will , keen to display his hospitality , when I need to head for home . � / Peisistratus asked himself if he could fulfil such a promise in all good conscience . 
After reflection , it seemed the right thing to do . 
So he turned the horses towards the swift ship and the shore , and there he unloaded Menelaus� fine gifts of clothing and gold , and stowed them in the vessel�s stern . 
Then he 
urged 
Telemachus on , with winged words : �Hurry and climb aboard , and have your crew embark as well , before I reach home and tell my father . I know in my heart and head that his spirit is such he will try to stop you leaving , and he�ll come himself to ask you to the palace , and I don�t think he�ll go back alone . Either way , he�ll be furious . � / 
Then he turned his long-maned horses towards the 
city of 
Pylos , and soon reached the palace , while 
Telemachus stirred his companions , and gave them his orders : �Board the ship , and clear the tackle , so we can be under way . � 
They quickly obeyed and leapt on board , then sat to the oars . / 
While 
Telemachus stood on shore , by the stern , busy praying and sacrificing to 
Athene , a stranger from a distant land approached , who was fleeing 
Argos after killing a man . 
He was a seer , a descendant of that Melampus who once lived in 
Pylos , the land of sheep . / Melampus was rich , with a fine house , but had to flee to a foreign country , to escape great 
Neleus , lord of men , who seized his wealth while Melampus was forcefully 
held in the palace at 
Phylace . 
He suffered all this grief and pain , and the terrible blindness of spirit that the avenging furies brought him , because of Neleus� daughter , Pero . 
Nevertheless he won free of fate , and drove Iphicles� cattle back to 
Pylos . 
Then he took vengeance on godlike 
Neleus for all his cruelty , and saw the girl married to his brother . as for himself , he went to another country , 
Argos the land of horses , where he was destined to live and rule a host of 
Argives . / 
There he married and built a high-roofed hall , and had two strong sons , 
Antiphates and 
Mantius . Oicles was Antiphates� son , and the great military leader 
Amphiaraus in turn was his , whom aegis-bearing 
Zeus and 
Apollo loved in every way . 
Even so he failed to make old bones , dying at 
Thebes , because of his wife�s greed . 
Alcmaeon and Amphilochus were his sons . / 
Mantius for his part was father of Polypheides and 
Cleitus . Golden-throned 
Dawn won by his beauty 
carried of 
Cleitus to live with the immortals , while 
Apollo made noble Polypheides his prophet , the greatest of all after 
Amphiaraus 
died . 
He quarrelled with his father and went to 
Hyperesia to live , where he prophesied to all . / 
It was 
Theoclymenus , his son , who now found 
Telemachus pouring libations in prayer by the swift black ship . 
He addressed 
Telemachus with winged words : �Friend , since I find you making sacrifice , I beg you by the god you pray to , and by those offerings , and by your own life and those of your comrades , to answer my questions truly , without concealment . 
Who are you , and where do you come from ? 
Which 
city is yours , and who are your parents ? � / 
And courteously 
Telemachus answered : �Well , stranger , I will give you an honest reply . I am from Ithaca , the son of 
Odysseus , as once was perhaps , for now he has surely met with some sad fate . 
Still , I launched a black ship with my friends and came here seeking news of my long-absent father . � / �I too , � said noble 
Theoclymenus , � I too have left my native place , because I killed a relative of mine . 
Argos , the horse country , is full of his kith and kin , and 
they have power in 
Achaea . I fled to avoid death�s dark fate at their hands : it seems it�s my destiny to be a wanderer among men . but I beg you : since 
they are on my trail , take me aboard your ship so 
they can�t kill me . � / �If you want to sail with us , I won�t say no , � wise 
Telemachus replied , �come with us and accept what hospitality we can offer . � 
With this he took Theoclymenus� bronze spear from him , and stowed it on deck , then 
they went aboard and he took his seat in the stern with 
Theoclymenus beside him , and the crew cast off the hawsers . 
Telemachus ordered his men to the tackle and 
they quickly obeyed , raising the pine mast and stepping it in its socket , making fast the forestays , then hoisting the white sail by its twisted ox-hide ropes . Bright-eyed 
Athene it was who sent them a following wind that gusted through the sky , so the ship would be quick to complete her journey over the brine . on 
they sailed by 
Crouni , and past 
Chalcis of the lovely streams . / The sun dipped , and the waves grew dark . The ship reached 
Pheae driven by a wind from 
Zeus , and on past glorious 
Elis , where the Epeians rule . 
Telemachus set a course from there for the nearby islands , wondering whether he would escape ambush or be killed . / 
Meanwhile 
Odysseus and the good swineherd were eating their supper in the hut , with the other men . 
When 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , 
Odysseus sounded out 
Eumaeus , to see if he would extend his generous hospitality and ask him to stay on at the farm , or whether he would send him on to town . �Eumaeus , and the rest of you , listen a moment . I think in the morning I�ll go off to town to beg , so as not to burden you all . Give me your best advice now , and a guide I can trust to show me the way . once there I must wander about by myself , and hope they�ll give me water and a crust of bread . I could go to noble Odysseus� house , and take wise 
Penelope my news , mingling with that crowd of insolent 
Suitors , and see if 
they�ll spare me dinner , since 
they don�t go short of good things . I could serve them too in any way they wish , for I�ll have you know , and mark this well , by the grace of 
Hermes the 
Messenger , who lends fame and accomplishment to a man�s work , no one else can compete with me in splitting firewood , setting a proper fire , roasting and carving meat or pouring wine , all those acts by which lesser men serve the high-born . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you were taken aback at this . �Stranger , what put such a thought in your mind ? 
You must be keen to die , if you really intend to join that crowd of 
Suitors , whose waywardness and violence echo to the heavens . Men like you are not the ones that serve them , 
they employ youngsters in smart tunics and cloaks , faces and hair gleaming with oil , to wait at their shining tables laden with bread and meat and cups of wine . No one is bothered by your presence here : I am certainly not : so stay . 
When Odysseus� noble son arrives he will give you a tunic and cloak to wear and send you on to whatever place you wish . � / 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus answered : �Eumaeus , may you be as dear to 
Father 
Zeus as you are to me , since you have saved me from wandering on in pain and hardship . 
Nothing is worse for men than homelessness , and when suffering and sorrow overtake them in their wanderings , 
they will try anything on behalf of an empty stomach . but since you bid me stay , and wait for your young master , tell me about godlike Odysseus� parents , whom he left behind in the fullness of their years . are 
they still living , under the sun , or are 
they dead in Hades� house ? � / �Stranger , �Eumaeus replied , �I will tell you plainly . 
Laertes lives , but prays endlessly for life to leave his body . 
He mourns his lost son deeply , and his wife , that wise lady , whose death hurt him most and aged him prematurely . 
She 
died a wretched death , grieving for her noble son , a death I would wish on no kind friend of mine living here . I always delighted in asking after her while she was still alive , despite her sadness , because she raised me alongside noble 
Ctimene her youngest daughter . The mother brought me up with her , and treated me as scarcely inferior to her own children . 
When we both reached youth�s sweet prime 
they sent her to Same to be wed , and earned countless marriage gifts , while the lady gave me a fine tunic and cloak , and sandals for my feet , and sent me to the fields , though in her heart she loved me no less . All that is done with now , though the blessed gods crown my labour with success . 
It provides me with meat and drink , and the means to welcome honoured strangers . but a plague of arrogant men has descended on my mistress� house , and prevents me receiving a single pleasant word or a kindness from her , though servants long to talk face to face with the mistress , and eat and drink and hear the news , and carry off some small gift to the farm , all the things that warm a servant�s heart . � / �Eumaeus , you must have been very young when you were separated from your far-off parents and your own land , � 
Odysseus replied . �Tell me , in truth , was it a 
city of broad streets that men sacked , where you honoured father and mother lived , or did raiders catch you tending the sheep and cattle alone , and carry you off in their ship to be sold to this master of yours for a good price ? � / �Stranger , � the master swineherd answered , �since you ask , well , enjoy your cup of wine and listen quietly to my tale . The nights are longer than even a god could tell . 
There is a time to sleep , and a time to delight in hearing a story . No need for you to sleep before you are ready : too much sleep can even weary us . as for you others , if anyone has a mind to rest , let him do so outside , and breakfast at dawn , and follow our master�s swine , but we two will eat and drink here in the hut , and savour each other�s memories of trouble and sadness , since a man who has suffered deeply and travelled far relishes even his sufferings in after days . let me tell you , then , the answers to your questions . � / �There�s an island called 
Syrie , you may have heard of , beyond 
Ortygia , where the sun turns in its course . 
It is sparsely populated , yet a fine land , rich in flocks and herds , yielding plenty of wine and wheat . famine is unknown there , and the people are free of the dreadful sicknesses that plague wretched mortals . as the generations of men grow old , 
Apollo of the 
Silver 
Bow visits their cities , with 
Artemis beside him , and strikes and slays them with gentle arrows . 
There are two cities , dividing the island between them , and my father , 
Ctesius , son of 
Ormenus , a godlike man , was king of both . / Sea-faring 
Phoenicians came to trade there , greedy rogues bringing a cargo of trinkets in their black ship . a 
Phoenician woman lived in my father�s house , tall and handsome and skilled in fine handiwork . The cunning 
Phoenicians seduced her . 
One lay with her by the hollow ship where she was washing clothes : such love beguiles the minds even of virtuous women . 
He asked who she was and where she came from , and she pointed to my father�s high-roofed house , saying : �I am from 
Sidon , rich in bronze , the daughter of wealthy 
Arybas . but 
Taphian raiders caught me as I came from the fields , brought me here and sold me into that man�s household , he paying a fine price . � / The man who had lain with her secretly said : �Do you wish to go home with us , and see your parents and their high-roofed house again ? 
They are still living , truly , and counted among the wealthy . � / �I might , � the woman said , �if you sailors would swear on oath to take me home in safety . � 
They all pledged to do as she asked , and when 
they had sworn their oath , the woman cautioned them : �Don�t any of you speak to me if you meet me at the well or in the street . 
Be silent , lest someone go the palace and tell the old king . if he suspects he will bind me tight and plan your deaths . 
Keep my words in mind , instead , and go off and barter your goods . 
Then , when your ship�s cargo is loaded , send a message quickly to me at the palace , and I will bring whatever gold is to hand . 
And I�ll gladly add something else to pay for my passage . I am nurse to a child of my master�s there in the house , a clever child who accompanies me everywhere . I�ll bring him on board , and he�ll fetch a great price in any foreign 
city where you land . � 
With these words she returned to the palace . / 
They stayed in the country a whole year , and acquired a ship�s full of cargo in trade . 
When the hollow ship was loaded , ready for sailing , 
they sent a messenger to the woman to tell her the news . The man was an expert in deceit , and he came to my father�s house bringing a necklace strung with gold and amber beads . 
While my dear mother and her maids examined and handled it , haggling over the price , he nodded silently to the woman . 
After his signal to her , he slipped away to the hollow ship , while she took me by the hand and led me from the house . in the portico she came across tables and drinking cups set out for those who attended on my father . 
They had gone to the council meeting in the debating hall , so she hid three of the goblets among her clothes , and took them with her , and I followed in all innocence . / The sun dipped and the streets grew dark . 
We hurried down to the fine harbour , where the Phoenicians� swift vessel waited . 
They embarked , taking us on board as well , and sailed away over the sea , on a favourable wind from 
Zeus . six days and nights we journeyed on , but when 
Zeus the son of 
Cronos brought the seventh day , 
Artemis the 
Archeress struck the woman who fell with a thud like a sea-bird into the hold . 
They 
tossed her overboard to feed the seals and fishes , and I was left heart-sick and alone . 
Then the wind and waves 
carried them here to Ithaca , where Laertes� wealth purchased me . That�s how I came to set eyes on this land . � / 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , said then : �Eumaeus , you have stirred my heart deeply with all this sad tale of trouble . Yet in your case , surely , 
Zeus has dealt you good with evil , since you reached the house of a generous man after all your suffering , who is kind enough to provide you with food and drink , so that you live well , while I have wandered through all the cities of men to reach this place . � / 
They talked together and then lay down to sleep for a while , though not for long since 
Dawn , of the lovely throne , approached . 
Meanwhile 
Telemachus was drawing near to the shore , and his crew were striking the sail . 
They swiftly dropped the mast , and rowed the ship to her anchorage . 
Then loosing the mooring stones 
they made the hawsers fast , and leapt on shore . 
There 
they prepared a meal and mixed the glowing wine , and when 
they had quenched hunger and thirst , wise 
Telemachus spoke first , and issued his orders . �Row the black ship to the 
city harbour , while I visit the herdsmen in the fields , and I will join you this evening when I�ve inspected my estate . 
Tomorrow morning I�ll set before you a sumptuous feast with meat and sweet wine , to thank you for your journey . � / �Dear boy , where am I to go ? � said godlike 
Theoclymenus . �Of those who reign in rocky Ithaca , whose house shall I visit ? or should I go straight to your and your mother�s house ? � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �At another time I�d invite you home as a matter of course . There�s no lack of hospitality towards strangers here . but it would be worse for you , since I shall be absent and my mother will avoid you , for she seldom shows herself to the 
Suitors in the hall , and works at her loom apart , in her room upstairs . but there is someone else whose house you can go to , 
Eurymachus , the noble son of wise Polybus . in Ithaca men consider him a god . 
He is the best of them : keenest to marry my mother and inherit Odysseus� power . but 
Olympian 
Zeus , the sky-dweller , alone knows whether he�ll bring a judgement or a wedding day . � / 
Even as he spoke a bird flew past on his right . 
It was a hawk , Apollo�s swift messenger , holding a dove in its talons , plucking the feathers that fluttered to earth half way between 
Telemachus and the ship . 
Theoclymenus drew him apart from his crew , and grasped his hand , saying : �Surely that bird flew past on the right at a god�s command . I knew when I saw him he was a bird of good omen . none are of more royal descent than you in Ithaca : you and your line will hold power forever . � / �Stranger , may that prove so , � wise 
Telemachus replied . �
Then you shall have many a gift and act of kindness from me , so that any man who meets you will call you blessed . � / Then he turned to 
Peiraeus , a loyal friend , saying : �Peiraeus , Clytius� son , who journeyed with me to 
Pylos , and have always been a most faithful friend to me , welcome this stranger to your house , I beg you , and show him honour and kindness till I come . � / �Telemachus , � that great spearman 
Peiraeus answered , �I shall entertain him however long you delay and he won�t lack for the hospitality due to strangers . � 
With this he went aboard , and told his friends to embark and then cast off . 
They climbed on deck , and the oarsmen took their seats . 
Then 
they loosed the cables , thrust her off , and rowed for the 
city as 
Telemachus , divine Odysseus� loyal son , had ordered . but he had already fastened fine sandals on his feet , and taken his strong sharp bronze-tipped spear from the deck . 
Now , striding quickly , his feet 
carried him towards the farm where the worthy swineherd , loyal to his masters , slept among a host of swine . / 
Meanwhile 
Pallas 
Athene sped to broad 
Lacedaemon to remind great-hearted Odysseus� noble son that it was time to head for home , and to hurry his departure . 
She found 
Telemachus and Peisistratus , Nestor�s noble son , in their beds in the porch of great Menelaus� palace . Nestor�s son was fast asleep , but sweet sleep eluded 
Telemachus , kept awake by anxious thoughts of his father , all that eternal night . Bright-eyed 
Athene stood by his bed , and spoke to him , saying : �Telemachus , it�s wrong to linger here far from home , leaving your wealth behind , with your house full of insolent men , lest 
they divide your goods and devour them , and your voyage proves worthless . 
Rouse 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry to send you on your way , instead , if you hope to find your peerless mother still in the palace . Her father and brothers are urging her to marry 
Eurymachus : he courts her with more and better gifts than the other 
Suitors . 
And have a care she doesn�t take a share of your wealth , despite your wishes . 
You know how women think : 
they want to add to a new husband�s glory , forgetting a faithful former partner once he�s dead , and no longer asking after their children by him . Go home , and put the best of your women servants in charge of your possessions , until the gods send you a worthy bride . / 
And here�s another thing for you to consider . The leading 
Suitors lie in wait for you , in the strait between Ithaca and rocky 
Samos , ready to kill you before you reach your native island . I think the earth will cover those who waste your wealth long before that day comes , but keep your fine ship far from the strait , and sail by night as well as by day , and that divine power that guards and protects you will send a following breeze . land at the first place you can on Ithaca , then send the ship and crew round to the harbour , but you yourself must find the swineherd who guards your pigs . 
He is well disposed towards you . 
Spend the night there , and send him to the 
city to tell wise 
Penelope you are back safely from 
Pylos . � / 
With this she left for the heights of Olympus , while 
Telemachus woke 
Nestor�s son from his sweet sleep with a nudge of his foot , and said : �Wake now , Peisistratus , son of Nestor , and harness your well-shod horses to the chariot , so we can be on our way . � / Peisitratus , waking , answered : �Telemachus , however eager you are we can�t drive in pitch darkness : dawn is not far off . Wait till 
Menelaus , the heroic spearman , Atreus� son , can bring his gifts and put them aboard the chariot , and send us on our way then with a kind farewell . a guest should always remember a host who shows him kindness . � / 
Soon golden-throned 
Dawn appeared , and 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry rose from where he slept , beside 
Helen of the lovely tresses , and approached them . 
When Odysseus� brave son , the hero , saw him he swiftly dressed in his shining tunic , flung a great cloak over his sturdy shoulders , and went to greet him , saying : �Menelaus , leader of men , son of 
Atreus , favoured of 
Zeus , send me on my way home , I am eager to return . � / 
And 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry said : �Telemachus , I�d never keep you here if you wish to leave , quite the opposite . I blame any host who yields or resists too much : moderation in all things . It�s as bad to hurry off a departing guest as to hold back one who�s anxious to go . 
One should give a warm welcome to the newcomer , and say a fond farewell to the man who�s leaving . 
Nevertheless , there�s time for me to load your chariot with fine gifts while you watch , and for me to have the servants find you a meal in the hall from all the plenty there . There�s a double benefit in a traveller feeding before he drives off into the wide open spaces , honour and glory to me , sustenance to you . if you want to see 
Hellas and central 
Argos , fine , I�ll travel with you , harness my horses and lead you to all the cities of men . They�ll not send us away empty-handed . They�ll give us some gift at least to take away , a solid bronze tripod or cauldron , a pair of mules , or a golden cup . � / �Menelaus , leader of men , son of 
Atreus , favoured of Zeus� , wise 
Telemachus replied , �I would rather go straight home , since I left no one in charge back there , and in seeking my godlike father I fear I may lose my own life , or some of my house�s valued treasures . � / 
When 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry heard this , he asked his wife to have her servants prepare a meal in the hall from the plenty there . Eteoneus , Boethous� son , who lived nearby and was fresh from his bed , arrived at that moment , and 
Menelaus asked him to light a fire , and roast some meat . 
He heard and obeyed , while 
Menelaus went off to his scented treasure room , taking 
Helen and Megapenthes with him . 
When 
they reached the store-house 
Menelaus chose a two-handled cup , and told his son Megapenthes to take a silver mixing-bowl , while 
Helen went to the chests holding richly-embroidered robes she had made herself . 
That most beautiful of women lifted out and 
carried off the largest and most beautifully worked of all . 
It had lain beneath the rest , and now glittered like a star . 
Then 
they walked back through the palace to 
Telemachus , and yellow-haired 
Menelaus spoke to him : / �Telemachus , may 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , Hera�s husband , grant you the homecoming you desire . The finest most precious of all the treasures in my store is the one I will give to you . This sweetly-made mixing bowl is solid silver rimmed with gold , and 
Hephaestus was its creator . 
Phaedimus the hero , the 
Sidonian 
King , gave it to me when his house sheltered me as I journeyed home , and now I give it to you . � / 
With this the heroic son of 
Atreus 
held out the two-handled cup to 
Telemachus , while mighty Megapenthes brought the silver mixing-bowl and placed it before him . 
Then 
Helen approached holding the robe , and addressed him : �Dear child , I too give you a gift to remember 
Helen by , made by her own hands , for your bride to wear when the longed-for wedding day arrives . let your dear mother keep it by her in the palace until then . as for yourself I wish you a joyful return to your own home and country . � 
Then she placed it in his hands , and he received it with pleasure . / Peisistratus , the hero , stowed the gifts in a chest inside the chariot , examining them admiringly . 
Then yellow-haired 
Menelaus led the way to the house , and 
they sat down on stools and chairs . a maid brought water in a fine golden jug so 
they could rinse their hands , pouring it over their hands into a silver basin . 
Then she brought a gleaming table , and the loyal housekeeper set bread and dishes of meat before them , giving freely of her stores . Eteoneus carved , and served the portions , and Megapenthes poured the wine . 
And 
they helped themselves to the meal . but once 
they had quenched hunger and thirst , 
Telemachus and Peisistratus harnessed the horses and mounting their inlaid chariot drove through the gate with its echoing portico . / The son of 
Atreus , yellow-haired 
Menelaus , followed , carrying a golden cup of honeyed wine in his right hand , so 
they could pour a final libation . standing beside the horses he pledged them , saying : �Farewell , youngsters , and greet 
Nestor , the shepherd of his people , for me . 
He was like a father to me when we 
Achaeans fought on the plains of 
Troy . � / �Rest assured we will do so , as soon as we arrive , favoured of 
Zeus . � said courteous 
Telemachus . �If only 
Odysseus were there at home in Ithaca too , and I returning to tell him of all the kindness I�ve met with at your hands while I was here , and of the many fine gifts I carry . � / as he was speaking an eagle flew over them to their right , gripping a large white goose in its talons , a tame bird snatched from the yard . 
Behind it men and women ran shouting , but the eagle still approached them and veered to the right in front of the horses , gladdening the hearts of those who saw it , and raising their spirits . Peisistratus , Nestor�s son , spoke first : �Menelaus , leader of men , favoured of 
Zeus , do you think the god sends this omen for you or for us ? � At this 
Menelaus took thought as to how the sign should be interpreted , but 
Helen of the long robe pre-empted his words , saying : �Listen and I will prophesy at the gods� prompting and as I am certain it will come to be . as the eagle flew from the mountain where he was born among his kin , and seized the goose bred for the table , so 
Odysseus will return to his house after much effort and wandering and take revenge : maybe he is there even now planning disaster for the 
Suitors . � / �May 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , Hera�s husband , make it so , � replied wise 
Telemachus , �and then when I�m there I�ll pray to you as a goddess . � / 
With this , 
Telemachus flicked his whip at the horses . 
They flew swiftly and eagerly through the town towards the plain , and all day long 
they strained at the yoke across their necks . / 
Now the sun dipped and the roads grew dark . 
And 
they came again to 
Pherae , to Diocles� house , Ortilochus� son whom 
Alpheius bore . 
There 
they passed the night , and he welcomed them , as strangers should be welcomed . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
they harnessed the horses , mounted the ornate chariot , and drove past the echoing portico out of the gate . 
Then 
Telemachus flicked the team with his whip to start them , and the willing pair flew onwards . 
Soon 
they reached the high citadel of 
Pylos , and turning to Peisistratus , he said : �Because of our father�s friendship we are friends , and we are of like age , and moreover this journey has united our hearts . 
Will you make me a promise , and execute it just as I say ? Favoured of 
Zeus , don�t drive on past my ship , but drop me off there , lest your father keeps me there at the palace against my will , keen to display his hospitality , when I need to head for home . � / Peisistratus asked himself if he could fulfil such a promise in all good conscience . 
After reflection , it seemed the right thing to do . 
So he turned the horses towards the swift ship and the shore , and there he unloaded Menelaus� fine gifts of clothing and gold , and stowed them in the vessel�s stern . 
Then he 
urged 
Telemachus on , with winged words : �Hurry and climb aboard , and have your crew embark as well , before I reach home and tell my father . I know in my heart and head that his spirit is such he will try to stop you leaving , and he�ll come himself to ask you to the palace , and I don�t think he�ll go back alone . Either way , he�ll be furious . � / 
Then he turned his long-maned horses towards the 
city of 
Pylos , and soon reached the palace , while 
Telemachus stirred his companions , and gave them his orders : �Board the ship , and clear the tackle , so we can be under way . � 
They quickly obeyed and leapt on board , then sat to the oars . / 
While 
Telemachus stood on shore , by the stern , busy praying and sacrificing to 
Athene , a stranger from a distant land approached , who was fleeing 
Argos after killing a man . 
He was a seer , a descendant of that Melampus who once lived in 
Pylos , the land of sheep . / Melampus was rich , with a fine house , but had to flee to a foreign country , to escape great 
Neleus , lord of men , who seized his wealth while Melampus was forcefully 
held in the palace at 
Phylace . 
He suffered all this grief and pain , and the terrible blindness of spirit that the avenging furies brought him , because of Neleus� daughter , Pero . 
Nevertheless he won free of fate , and drove Iphicles� cattle back to 
Pylos . 
Then he took vengeance on godlike 
Neleus for all his cruelty , and saw the girl married to his brother . as for himself , he went to another country , 
Argos the land of horses , where he was destined to live and rule a host of 
Argives . / 
There he married and built a high-roofed hall , and had two strong sons , 
Antiphates and 
Mantius . Oicles was Antiphates� son , and the great military leader 
Amphiaraus in turn was his , whom aegis-bearing 
Zeus and 
Apollo loved in every way . 
Even so he failed to make old bones , dying at 
Thebes , because of his wife�s greed . 
Alcmaeon and Amphilochus were his sons . / 
Mantius for his part was father of Polypheides and 
Cleitus . Golden-throned 
Dawn won by his beauty 
carried of 
Cleitus to live with the immortals , while 
Apollo made noble Polypheides his prophet , the greatest of all after 
Amphiaraus 
died . 
He quarrelled with his father and went to 
Hyperesia to live , where he prophesied to all . / 
It was 
Theoclymenus , his son , who now found 
Telemachus pouring libations in prayer by the swift black ship . 
He addressed 
Telemachus with winged words : �Friend , since I find you making sacrifice , I beg you by the god you pray to , and by those offerings , and by your own life and those of your comrades , to answer my questions truly , without concealment . 
Who are you , and where do you come from ? 
Which 
city is yours , and who are your parents ? � / 
And courteously 
Telemachus answered : �Well , stranger , I will give you an honest reply . I am from Ithaca , the son of 
Odysseus , as once was perhaps , for now he has surely met with some sad fate . 
Still , I launched a black ship with my friends and came here seeking news of my long-absent father . � / �I too , � said noble 
Theoclymenus , � I too have left my native place , because I killed a relative of mine . 
Argos , the horse country , is full of his kith and kin , and 
they have power in 
Achaea . I fled to avoid death�s dark fate at their hands : it seems it�s my destiny to be a wanderer among men . but I beg you : since 
they are on my trail , take me aboard your ship so 
they can�t kill me . � / �If you want to sail with us , I won�t say no , � wise 
Telemachus replied , �come with us and accept what hospitality we can offer . � 
With this he took Theoclymenus� bronze spear from him , and stowed it on deck , then 
they went aboard and he took his seat in the stern with 
Theoclymenus beside him , and the crew cast off the hawsers . 
Telemachus ordered his men to the tackle and 
they quickly obeyed , raising the pine mast and stepping it in its socket , making fast the forestays , then hoisting the white sail by its twisted ox-hide ropes . Bright-eyed 
Athene it was who sent them a following wind that gusted through the sky , so the ship would be quick to complete her journey over the brine . on 
they sailed by 
Crouni , and past 
Chalcis of the lovely streams . / The sun dipped , and the waves grew dark . The ship reached 
Pheae driven by a wind from 
Zeus , and on past glorious 
Elis , where the Epeians rule . 
Telemachus set a course from there for the nearby islands , wondering whether he would escape ambush or be killed . / 
Meanwhile 
Odysseus and the good swineherd were eating their supper in the hut , with the other men . 
When 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , 
Odysseus sounded out 
Eumaeus , to see if he would extend his generous hospitality and ask him to stay on at the farm , or whether he would send him on to town . �Eumaeus , and the rest of you , listen a moment . I think in the morning I�ll go off to town to beg , so as not to burden you all . Give me your best advice now , and a guide I can trust to show me the way . once there I must wander about by myself , and hope they�ll give me water and a crust of bread . I could go to noble Odysseus� house , and take wise 
Penelope my news , mingling with that crowd of insolent 
Suitors , and see if 
they�ll spare me dinner , since 
they don�t go short of good things . I could serve them too in any way they wish , for I�ll have you know , and mark this well , by the grace of 
Hermes the 
Messenger , who lends fame and accomplishment to a man�s work , no one else can compete with me in splitting firewood , setting a proper fire , roasting and carving meat or pouring wine , all those acts by which lesser men serve the high-born . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you were taken aback at this . �Stranger , what put such a thought in your mind ? 
You must be keen to die , if you really intend to join that crowd of 
Suitors , whose waywardness and violence echo to the heavens . Men like you are not the ones that serve them , 
they employ youngsters in smart tunics and cloaks , faces and hair gleaming with oil , to wait at their shining tables laden with bread and meat and cups of wine . No one is bothered by your presence here : I am certainly not : so stay . 
When Odysseus� noble son arrives he will give you a tunic and cloak to wear and send you on to whatever place you wish . � / 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus answered : �Eumaeus , may you be as dear to 
Father 
Zeus as you are to me , since you have saved me from wandering on in pain and hardship . 
Nothing is worse for men than homelessness , and when suffering and sorrow overtake them in their wanderings , 
they will try anything on behalf of an empty stomach . but since you bid me stay , and wait for your young master , tell me about godlike Odysseus� parents , whom he left behind in the fullness of their years . are 
they still living , under the sun , or are 
they dead in Hades� house ? � / �Stranger , �Eumaeus replied , �I will tell you plainly . 
Laertes lives , but prays endlessly for life to leave his body . 
He mourns his lost son deeply , and his wife , that wise lady , whose death hurt him most and aged him prematurely . 
She 
died a wretched death , grieving for her noble son , a death I would wish on no kind friend of mine living here . I always delighted in asking after her while she was still alive , despite her sadness , because she raised me alongside noble 
Ctimene her youngest daughter . The mother brought me up with her , and treated me as scarcely inferior to her own children . 
When we both reached youth�s sweet prime 
they sent her to Same to be wed , and earned countless marriage gifts , while the lady gave me a fine tunic and cloak , and sandals for my feet , and sent me to the fields , though in her heart she loved me no less . All that is done with now , though the blessed gods crown my labour with success . 
It provides me with meat and drink , and the means to welcome honoured strangers . but a plague of arrogant men has descended on my mistress� house , and prevents me receiving a single pleasant word or a kindness from her , though servants long to talk face to face with the mistress , and eat and drink and hear the news , and carry off some small gift to the farm , all the things that warm a servant�s heart . � / �Eumaeus , you must have been very young when you were separated from your far-off parents and your own land , � 
Odysseus replied . �Tell me , in truth , was it a 
city of broad streets that men sacked , where you honoured father and mother lived , or did raiders catch you tending the sheep and cattle alone , and carry you off in their ship to be sold to this master of yours for a good price ? � / �Stranger , � the master swineherd answered , �since you ask , well , enjoy your cup of wine and listen quietly to my tale . The nights are longer than even a god could tell . 
There is a time to sleep , and a time to delight in hearing a story . No need for you to sleep before you are ready : too much sleep can even weary us . as for you others , if anyone has a mind to rest , let him do so outside , and breakfast at dawn , and follow our master�s swine , but we two will eat and drink here in the hut , and savour each other�s memories of trouble and sadness , since a man who has suffered deeply and travelled far relishes even his sufferings in after days . let me tell you , then , the answers to your questions . � / �There�s an island called 
Syrie , you may have heard of , beyond 
Ortygia , where the sun turns in its course . 
It is sparsely populated , yet a fine land , rich in flocks and herds , yielding plenty of wine and wheat . famine is unknown there , and the people are free of the dreadful sicknesses that plague wretched mortals . as the generations of men grow old , 
Apollo of the 
Silver 
Bow visits their cities , with 
Artemis beside him , and strikes and slays them with gentle arrows . 
There are two cities , dividing the island between them , and my father , 
Ctesius , son of 
Ormenus , a godlike man , was king of both . / Sea-faring 
Phoenicians came to trade there , greedy rogues bringing a cargo of trinkets in their black ship . a 
Phoenician woman lived in my father�s house , tall and handsome and skilled in fine handiwork . The cunning 
Phoenicians seduced her . 
One lay with her by the hollow ship where she was washing clothes : such love beguiles the minds even of virtuous women . 
He asked who she was and where she came from , and she pointed to my father�s high-roofed house , saying : �I am from 
Sidon , rich in bronze , the daughter of wealthy 
Arybas . but 
Taphian raiders caught me as I came from the fields , brought me here and sold me into that man�s household , he paying a fine price . � / The man who had lain with her secretly said : �Do you wish to go home with us , and see your parents and their high-roofed house again ? 
They are still living , truly , and counted among the wealthy . � / �I might , � the woman said , �if you sailors would swear on oath to take me home in safety . � 
They all pledged to do as she asked , and when 
they had sworn their oath , the woman cautioned them : �Don�t any of you speak to me if you meet me at the well or in the street . 
Be silent , lest someone go the palace and tell the old king . if he suspects he will bind me tight and plan your deaths . 
Keep my words in mind , instead , and go off and barter your goods . 
Then , when your ship�s cargo is loaded , send a message quickly to me at the palace , and I will bring whatever gold is to hand . 
And I�ll gladly add something else to pay for my passage . I am nurse to a child of my master�s there in the house , a clever child who accompanies me everywhere . I�ll bring him on board , and he�ll fetch a great price in any foreign 
city where you land . � 
With these words she returned to the palace . / 
They stayed in the country a whole year , and acquired a ship�s full of cargo in trade . 
When the hollow ship was loaded , ready for sailing , 
they sent a messenger to the woman to tell her the news . The man was an expert in deceit , and he came to my father�s house bringing a necklace strung with gold and amber beads . 
While my dear mother and her maids examined and handled it , haggling over the price , he nodded silently to the woman . 
After his signal to her , he slipped away to the hollow ship , while she took me by the hand and led me from the house . in the portico she came across tables and drinking cups set out for those who attended on my father . 
They had gone to the council meeting in the debating hall , so she hid three of the goblets among her clothes , and took them with her , and I followed in all innocence . / The sun dipped and the streets grew dark . 
We hurried down to the fine harbour , where the Phoenicians� swift vessel waited . 
They embarked , taking us on board as well , and sailed away over the sea , on a favourable wind from 
Zeus . six days and nights we journeyed on , but when 
Zeus the son of 
Cronos brought the seventh day , 
Artemis the 
Archeress struck the woman who fell with a thud like a sea-bird into the hold . 
They 
tossed her overboard to feed the seals and fishes , and I was left heart-sick and alone . 
Then the wind and waves 
carried them here to Ithaca , where Laertes� wealth purchased me . That�s how I came to set eyes on this land . � / 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , said then : �Eumaeus , you have stirred my heart deeply with all this sad tale of trouble . Yet in your case , surely , 
Zeus has dealt you good with evil , since you reached the house of a generous man after all your suffering , who is kind enough to provide you with food and drink , so that you live well , while I have wandered through all the cities of men to reach this place . � / 
They talked together and then lay down to sleep for a while , though not for long since 
Dawn , of the lovely throne , approached . 
Meanwhile 
Telemachus was drawing near to the shore , and his crew were striking the sail . 
They swiftly dropped the mast , and rowed the ship to her anchorage . 
Then loosing the mooring stones 
they made the hawsers fast , and leapt on shore . 
There 
they prepared a meal and mixed the glowing wine , and when 
they had quenched hunger and thirst , wise 
Telemachus spoke first , and issued his orders . �Row the black ship to the 
city harbour , while I visit the herdsmen in the fields , and I will join you this evening when I�ve inspected my estate . 
Tomorrow morning I�ll set before you a sumptuous feast with meat and sweet wine , to thank you for your journey . � / �Dear boy , where am I to go ? � said godlike 
Theoclymenus . �Of those who reign in rocky Ithaca , whose house shall I visit ? or should I go straight to your and your mother�s house ? � / 
Wise 
Telemachus replied : �At another time I�d invite you home as a matter of course . There�s no lack of hospitality towards strangers here . but it would be worse for you , since I shall be absent and my mother will avoid you , for she seldom shows herself to the 
Suitors in the hall , and works at her loom apart , in her room upstairs . but there is someone else whose house you can go to , 
Eurymachus , the noble son of wise Polybus . in Ithaca men consider him a god . 
He is the best of them : keenest to marry my mother and inherit Odysseus� power . but 
Olympian 
Zeus , the sky-dweller , alone knows whether he�ll bring a judgement or a wedding day . � / 
Even as he spoke a bird flew past on his right . 
It was a hawk , Apollo�s swift messenger , holding a dove in its talons , plucking the feathers that fluttered to earth half way between 
Telemachus and the ship . 
Theoclymenus drew him apart from his crew , and grasped his hand , saying : �Surely that bird flew past on the right at a god�s command . I knew when I saw him he was a bird of good omen . none are of more royal descent than you in Ithaca : you and your line will hold power forever . � / �Stranger , may that prove so , � wise 
Telemachus replied . �
Then you shall have many a gift and act of kindness from me , so that any man who meets you will call you blessed . � / Then he turned to 
Peiraeus , a loyal friend , saying : �Peiraeus , Clytius� son , who journeyed with me to 
Pylos , and have always been a most faithful friend to me , welcome this stranger to your house , I beg you , and show him honour and kindness till I come . � / �Telemachus , � that great spearman 
Peiraeus answered , �I shall entertain him however long you delay and he won�t lack for the hospitality due to strangers . � 
With this he went aboard , and told his friends to embark and then cast off . 
They climbed on deck , and the oarsmen took their seats . 
Then 
they loosed the cables , thrust her off , and rowed for the 
city as 
Telemachus , divine Odysseus� loyal son , had ordered . but he had already fastened fine sandals on his feet , and taken his strong sharp bronze-tipped spear from the deck . 
Now , striding quickly , his feet 
carried him towards the farm where the worthy swineherd , loyal to his masters , slept among a host of swine . /
