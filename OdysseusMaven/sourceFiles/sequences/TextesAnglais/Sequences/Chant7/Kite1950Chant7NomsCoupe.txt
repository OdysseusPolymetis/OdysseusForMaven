
So noble long-suffering 
Odysseus prayed there , while the pair of sturdy mules drew the girl to the 
city . 
When she 
had reached her father�s great palace , she halted the mules at the gate , and her brothers , godlike men , crowded round her . 
They unhitched the mules from the cart , and 
carried the clothing inside , while she went to her room . 
There her waiting-woman , 
Eurymedusa , an old 
Aperaean woman , lit a fire . Curved ships 
had brought her from 
Aperaea long ago , and she 
had been chosen from the spoils as a prize for 
Alcinous , king of all the 
Phaeacians , considered a god by the people . 
She 
had reared 
Nausicaa of the white arms in the palace , and now she lit the fire , and prepared supper in the room . / It was then 
Odysseus started for town , and 
Athene , showing her kindness , veiled him in dense mist , so that none of the brave 
Phaeacians meeting him , would challenge him , or ask who he was . 
And as he was about to enter the fine 
city , the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , met him , disguised as a young girl with a pitcher , and stopped in front of him . �My child , � said noble 
Odysseus , �can you guide me to the house of him they call 
Alcinous , lord of this people ? I come as a long-suffering stranger from far off , and I know none of the people of this land or its 
city . � / 
The goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene answered : �Sir stranger , I will show you the place you ask for , since 
Alcinous lives near my good father�s house . 
Only walk quietly , and I will lead the way : look at nobody and ask no questions , for these people are intolerant of strangers , and do not welcome people from abroad . 
Trusting to their fast ships , they cross the wide gulfs of sea , and 
Poseidon allows it : and these ships are as quick as a bird in flight , or a thought . � / 
With this , 
Pallas 
Athene promptly led the way , and he followed in the goddess� footsteps . 
The 
Phaeacians , so proud of their ships , failed to see him as he crossed the 
city , since dread 
Athene prevented it , veiling him in a magic mist , because of her concern for him . 
And 
Odysseus 
marvelled at the harbour and the fine vessels , at the meeting place where the nobles gathered , and the long high walls topped with palisades , wonderful to see . 
When they reached the king�s fine palace , the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , said : �Here , sir stranger , is the house you asked me to show you . 
You will find the princes , favoured by 
Zeus , feasting there , but go in and have no fear . for a man is best to be bold , even a stranger from a foreign land . 
The first person you will approach in the palace hall is the queen : 
Arete is her name , of the same lineage as the king , 
Alcinous . 
Nausithous was founder , born of 
Earth-Shaker 
Poseidon and Periboea , loveliest of women , youngest daughter of valiant 
Eurymedon once king of the insolent Giants . He brought destruction on his reckless race , and was destroyed . but 
Poseidon lay with Periboea , and bore a son , valiant 
Nausithous , who ruled the 
Phaeacians , and 
Nausithous 
had two sons , 
Rhexenor and 
Alcinous . 
Rhexenor , who was married without a son , 
Apollo of the silver bow struck down in his hall , leaving a daughter , 
Arete . 
Alcinous married her , and honours her above all those women on earth who keep house at their husband�s command . 
Such is the heartfelt honour she ever enjoys from her children , and 
Alcinous , and the people , who think of her as a goddess , greeting her as she walks through the 
city . for she is no less wise , and settles the disputes of those she favours , men or women . if she looks kindly on you , there is hope you may see your friends again , and return to your vaulted hall in your own land . � / 
With this , bright-eyed 
Athene left lovely 
Scherie , and vanished over the barren sea . 
She reached marathon , and the wide streets of 
Athens , and entered Erectheus� palace , while 
Odysseus 
approached 
Alcinous� glorious halls . He stood there reflecting , before crossing the bronze threshold , since the radiance of sun or moon shone over the vaulted halls of valiant Alcinous . 
The walls that ran from the entrance to the innermost room were topped with a frieze of blue enamelling . gold doors fronted the well-built house , with silver doorposts set in the bronze sill . 
The lintel above was silver too , and the door-handle of gold . gold and silver dogs stood either side , fashioned by 
Hephaestus with consummate skill , to guard valiant Alcinous� palace . 
They were ageless and immortal . Inside , seats were fixed along the walls from the entrance to the innermost room , covered with cleverly woven fabrics worked by the women . 
There the 
Phaeacian princes would sit , eating and drinking , living 
lavishly . golden statues of youths on solid pedestals stood there , with flaming torches in their hands , to light the banqueting hall by night . / 
And 
Alcinous 
had fifty housemaids , some of whom ground golden corn on the millstone , others wove fabric , or twisted the yarn , hands flickering like the leaves of a tall poplar , while the smooth bleaching olive oil dripped down . as the 
Phaeacian men are skilled at handling ships on the sea , so the women are clever workers at the loom , for 
Athene has given them knowledge of beautiful arts , and great application . / 
Beyond the courtyard , near to the doors , lies a large four-acre orchard , surrounded by a hedge . 
Tall , heavily laden trees grow there , pear , pomegranate and apple , rich in glossy fruit , sweet figs and dense olives . 
The fruit never rots or fails , winter or summer . It lasts all year , and the 
West Wind�s breath quickens some to life , and ripens others , pear on pear , apple on apple , cluster on cluster of grapes , and fig on fig . 
There is Alcinous� fertile vineyard too , with a warm patch of level ground in one part set aside for drying the grapes , while the labourers gather and tread others , as the foremost rows of unripe grapes shed their blossom , and others become tinged with purple . 
Beyond the furthest row again are neat beds with every kind of plant , flowering all year round , and there are two springs in the orchard , one flowing through the whole garden , while the other runs the opposite way , under the courtyard sill , near where the people of the 
city draw their water , towards the great house . 
Such were the gods� glorious gifts to Alcinous� home . / noble , long-suffering 
Odysseus stood and gazed around . 
When he 
had wondered deeply at it all , he crossed the palace threshold swiftly . 
There he found the 
Phaeacian leaders and counsellors pouring libations from their cups to keen-eyed 
Hermes , the slayer of argus , to whom they would pour the last of the wine before retiring to rest . but noble long-suffering 
Odysseus traversed the hall , veiled in the dense mist 
Athene 
had shed around him , till he came to 
Arete and 
Alcinous the king . 
Odysseus 
clasped Arete�s knees , and the magic mist melted away , and all in the room were silenced at the sight of this man , and 
marvelled as they gazed . 
Then 
Odysseus made this prayer : / �Arete , daughter of godlike 
Rhexenor , after many labours I come as a suppliant to your knees , at your husband�s feet and your guests� , and may the gods bring them happiness in life , and may each leave the wealth of these halls , and his honours from the people , to his children . but let me be returned quickly to my own land , for I have long suffered trouble far from my friends . � / 
With this he sat down in the hearth�s ashes , close to the fire , and all remained silent . At last one of the 
Phaeacian elders , noble Echeneus , eloquent and wise , spoke to them . 
Helpfully , he addressed the gathering , saying : �Come , 
Alcinous , it is not right and proper that a stranger should sit there in the ashes of the hearth , while we all hold back awaiting your lead . 
Raise the stranger to his feet , and seat him on a silver-embossed chair , and let the heralds mix the wine , so that we may pour libations to 
Zeus as well , who hurls the lightning and follows the footsteps of holy suppliants . 
And let the housekeeper feed him supper from her store . � / 
When royal 
Alcinous 
had listened , he 
clasped the wise and clever 
Odysseus by the hand , raised him from the hearth , and seated him on a shining chair , from which he moved his son , kindly 
Laodamas , his favourite , who sat beside him . a maid brought water to wash his hands in a fine gold pitcher , and poured it over a silver basin , and drew up a polished table beside him . 
And the well-respected housekeeper brought bread and set it before him , with many delicacies , giving freely of her store . 
So noble long-suffering 
Odysseus ate and drank . 
Then royal 
Alcinous spoke to his squire and said : / �Pontonous , mix and serve the wine to everyone in the hall , so we can pour libations to 
Zeus who hurls the lightning , since he follows the footsteps of holy suppliants . � / At this , Pontonous mixed the honeyed wine , and poured the first drops into every cup . 
When they 
had poured their libations and drunk what they wished , 
Alcinous addressed the gathering , saying : �Leaders and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , listen while I speak what is in my heart . 
Now you have dined , go to your homes and rest , and in the morning we will call a wider assembly of elders , and entertain this stranger , and offer sacrifices to the gods . After that we can think about his quick and happy return , without pain or effort , to his native land , however far he may have come . 
And he shall not suffer accident or harm till he sets foot in his own country : though afterwards he must fulfil whatever thread of destiny the 
Dread 
Fates spun for him at birth . but if he is one of the immortals come down from heaven , then this is some new project of the gods , since they always appeared plainly to us before , after we 
had offered them rich sacrifice , and they sat and feasted among us . Even if one of us walking the road alone were to meet them , they used no disguise , since we are next of kin to them , like the cyclopes and the wild tribe of Giants . � / 
Then resourceful 
Odysseus spoke to him , saying : �Do not imagine so , 
Alcinous , since I have neither the looks nor stature of the immortals who inhabit wide heaven , but those of mortal men . Whoever you know that bear the heaviest burden of suffering , I might compare myself to them in sorrow . 
Yes , and the tale of all the troubles that by the gods� will I have endured , would be longer . but despite my grief , let me eat , since there is nothing more shameful than the wretched stomach that demands a man�s attention however deep his distress , or heavy his heart , and my heart is heavy now , yet my stomach goes on insisting I eat and drink , making me forget what I suffered , demanding its fill . 
Then at daybreak , indeed , hurry to return me to my native soil , wretched as I am , and after all my troubles . 
Then , let me die , having seen again my goods , my servants , my vaulted halls . � / He spoke , and they all praised his speech , and proposed to send the stranger on his journey home , since he 
had spoken well . 
When they 
had poured libations , and drunk their fill , each man went home to rest , while noble 
Odysseus was left behind in the hall , seated beside 
Arete and godlike 
Alcinous , as the maids cleared the dishes from the feast . 
Arete of the white arms was first to speak , since as soon as she saw his fine clothes she recognised them as ones she and her women 
had made . 
She spoke to him with winged words : �Stranger , I will be the first to ask who you are and where you are from . 
Who gave you those clothes ? 
Did you not say you reached here wandering the sea ? � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus replied , saying : �My queen , it would be difficult to recount the story of my sufferings from start to end , since the gods in heaven have inflicted so many on me . but I will say this in answer to your question . 
There is an isle , 
Ogygia , far across the sea , where artful 
Calypso of the lovely tresses , the daughter of atlas , lives , and neither gods nor mortals approach her , but fate brought me alone to her in my misfortune , for 
Zeus 
had struck my ship with his bright lightning , and wrecked it far out on the wine-dark sea . 
There my loyal friends were drowned , but I grasped the keel of my curved ship , and drifted for nine days , till on the tenth night of darkness the gods washed me shore on 
Ogygia , where lives that dread goddess 
Calypso of the lovely tresses . 
She welcomed me to her home with kindness , fed me , and promised to make me ageless and immortal , but she never reached my heart . Seven whole years I stayed there , soaking the everlasting garments 
Calypso gave me with my tears . but when the eighth year came round , she urged me to go , because of some message from 
Zeus , or because her feelings 
had changed . 
She sent me off on a tight-bound raft , with a wealth of provisions , bread and glowing wine , and gave me everlasting garments to wear , and sent a following wind , warm and gentle . / 
So I sailed the sea for seventeen days , and on the eighteenth the shadowy mountains of your land appeared , and I was joyful , but ill fated , since I was still to be a friend of great suffering , that 
Poseidon 
Earth-Shaker brought me . He roused the winds against me , blocked my path , and raised huge waves , so the sea refused to leave me alone as I sat there groaning ceaselessly aboard my raft . 
Instead the storm wrecked it , and I reached here , swimming the great gulf till the wind and waves 
carried me to your shore . 
When I tried to gain the land , the breakers dashed me against a dangerous stretch of cliff , but I backed away , and swam till I came to a river mouth , where there was a likely place , free of rocks and sheltered from the wind . I staggered clear , and lay there , gasping for breath , while deathless night fell . 
Then I climbed from the bed of the heaven-fed river , and , gathering leaves around me , lay down to rest in a thicket . 
Then a god shed boundless sleep upon me . 
So I slept all night through , exhausted , among the leaves , through morning and till noon , and the sun began to set before sweet sleep released me . 
Then I saw your daughter�s maids playing on the sand , and she among them looking like a goddess . I made my prayer to her , and she was full of understanding , in a way you would not expect from one so young , since the young are ever thoughtless . 
She gave me plenty of bread and glowing wine , bathed me in the river , and gave me these clothes . 
This is the truth I tell , regardless of its pain . � / 
Then 
Alcinous replied : �Indeed , 
Stranger , my daughter was at fault in this , that she failed to lead you to our house with her maids , though it was her to whom you first prayed . � / but shrewd 
Odysseus answered : �Lord , do not criticise your daughter , who is flawless , I beg you . 
She did ask me to follow her and her maids , but I refused out of shame and fear , thinking your mind might cloud with anger when you saw us , since the peoples of earth are quick to anger . � / �My friend , � 
Alcinous replied , �my character is not one to take offence without cause . in all things moderation is best . by 
Zeus , the 
Father , 
Athene and 
Apollo , given the sort of man you are , similar to myself , I wish you would wed my daughter , be my son , and stay . I would give you a house and wealth if you chose to remain here , but no 
Phaeacian would detain you against your will , may 
Father 
Zeus forbid . 
So you can be certain of beginning your homeward voyage , I appoint tomorrow as the day . 
While you sleep they will row you over calm seas , till you come to your own house and country , or wherever else you wish , even if it lies beyond 
Euboea . 
Those of our people who took yellow-haired 
Rhadamanthus to visit 
Tityus , son of 
Earth , saw that place and call it the world�s end . 
They sailed there , without effort , completed their task , and returned home the selfsame day . 
So you see for yourself that my ships are of the best , and my young men supreme at driving oars through the brine . � / At this , noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was pleased , and he raised his voice in prayer , saying : �Father 
Zeus , let 
Alcinous achieve all he has said . 
Then his fame will be inextinguishable on the fruitful earth , and I will reach my native shore . � / 
While they spoke , 
Arete of the white arms told her maids to place a bed in the portico , and cover it with fine purple blankets , with covers on top , and fleecy cloaks for warmth . Torch in hand , the maids went out of the hall . but when they 
had quickly covered the well-made bed , they came and called 
Odysseus saying : �Stranger , come and rest , your bed is made . � 
The thought of sleep was welcome to him . 
And the noble long-suffering 
Odysseus lay there on the wooden bed in the echoing portico . but 
Alcinous himself slept in the innermost room of the tall building , and with him his lady wife for love and comfort . / 
So noble long-suffering 
Odysseus prayed there , while the pair of sturdy mules drew the girl to the 
city . 
When she 
had reached her father�s great palace , she halted the mules at the gate , and her brothers , godlike men , crowded round her . 
They unhitched the mules from the cart , and 
carried the clothing inside , while she went to her room .

Then I saw your daughter�s maids playing on the sand , and she among them looking like a goddess . I made my prayer to her , and she was full of understanding , in a way you would not expect from one so young , since the young are ever thoughtless . 
She gave me plenty of bread and glowing wine , bathed me in the river , and gave me these clothes . 
This is the truth I tell , regardless of its pain . � / 
Then 
Alcinous replied : �Indeed , 
Stranger , my daughter was at fault in this , that she failed to lead you to our house with her maids , though it was her to whom you first prayed . � / but shrewd 
Odysseus answered : �Lord , do not criticise your daughter , who is flawless , I beg you . 
She did ask me to follow her and her maids , but I refused out of shame and fear , thinking your mind might cloud with anger when you saw us , since the peoples of earth are quick to anger . � / �My friend , � 
Alcinous replied , �my character is not one to take offence without cause . in all things moderation is best . by 
Zeus , the 
Father , 
Athene and 
Apollo , given the sort of man you are , similar to myself , I wish you would wed my daughter , be my son , and stay . I would give you a house and wealth if you chose to remain here , but no 
Phaeacian would detain you against your will , may 
Father 
Zeus forbid . 
So you can be certain of beginning your homeward voyage , I appoint tomorrow as the day . 
While you sleep they will row you over calm seas , till you come to your own house and country , or wherever else you wish , even if it lies beyond 
Euboea . 
Those of our people who took yellow-haired 
Rhadamanthus to visit 
Tityus , son of 
Earth , saw that place and call it the world�s end . 
They sailed there , without effort , completed their task , and returned home the selfsame day . 
So you see for yourself that my ships are of the best , and my young men supreme at driving oars through the brine . � / At this , noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was pleased , and he raised his voice in prayer , saying : �Father 
Zeus , let 
Alcinous achieve all he has said . 
Then his fame will be inextinguishable on the fruitful earth , and I will reach my native shore . � / 
While they spoke , 
Arete of the white arms told her maids to place a bed in the portico , and cover it with fine purple blankets , with covers on top , and fleecy cloaks for warmth . Torch in hand , the maids went out of the hall . but when they 
had quickly covered the well-made bed , they came and called 
Odysseus saying : �Stranger , come and rest , your bed is made . � 
The thought of sleep was welcome to him . 
And the noble long-suffering 
Odysseus lay there on the wooden bed in the echoing portico . but 
Alcinous himself slept in the innermost room of the tall building , and with him his lady wife for love and comfort . /
