as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , godlike Odysseus� steadfast son 
Telemachus , eager to leave for the 
city , strapped on his fine sandals , picked up his sturdy spear , one comfortable to hold , and 
said to the swineherd : �Old friend , I�m off to town to find my mother : she won�t stop her sad weeping , her tearful grieving , till she sees me in the flesh . 
Here are my orders for you . guide this unfortunate stranger to the 
city , so he can beg for food there : someone may decide to give him a crust and a cup of water . 
With all my troubles I can�t bear everyone�s burden myself . 
So much the worse for him if that should make him genuinely angry . I would rather speak the truth . � / 
Then resourceful 
Odysseus spoke up , saying : �Friend , I no more wish to be left here myself . It�s better for a beggar to beg in town than in the country : someone may decide to give me food . I�m too old to live on a farm at some master�s beck and call . Go ahead , and this man will take me there as you command , when I�ve warmed myself at the fire and the sun has some heat , since the rags I wear are wretchedly thin , and I fear the morning frost might prove too much for me , given that you tell me it�s a long walk to town . � / 
At this , 
Telemachus strode off quickly through the farm , planning disaster for the 
Suitors . 
When he reached the royal palace , he leant his spear against a tall pillar , and crossed the stone threshold . / 
The nurse , 
Eurycleia , who was spreading fleecy covers on the fine-wrought chairs , was first to see him . She rushed towards him , in floods of tears , while noble Odysseus� other maids gathered round him , welcoming him lovingly with kisses on head and shoulders . / 
Soon wise 
Penelope , the image of Artemis or golden 
Aphrodite , came from her room , and weeping threw her arms round her dear son , kissing his face and his fine eyes , and sobbed out winged words : �Telemachus , light of my eyes , here you are . I thought I would never see you again when you left in your ship for 
Pylos to seek news of your brave father , secretly and against my wishes . Come tell me what news you have of him . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Mother , don�t rouse my tears , don�t stir my emotions : I�ve barely escaped from total ruin . 
Bathe , and dress yourself in clean linen , then go to your room upstairs with your women , and promise the gods a perfect offering , hoping that 
Zeus might bring about a day of judgement . I will go to the gathering place and invite a guest to our house , a stranger who returned from 
Pylos with me . I sent him on ahead with my noble friends , and told Peiraeus to take him home and welcome him , and show him kindness and honour till I came . � / To these words of his she made no reply , but went and bathed , and dressed in clean linen , and promised the gods a perfect offering , hoping that 
Zeus might bring about a day of judgement . / 
Then 
Telemachus , spear in hand , with two swift hounds at his heels , left by way of the hall . 
And 
Athene granted him such miraculous grace that every face turned to him in wonder as he passed . 
The noble 
Suitors crowded round him speaking words of respect while plotting evil in the depths of their hearts . but he evaded the dense throng , and took his place alongside mentor , 
Antiphus and 
Halitherses , his father�s friends of old . as 
they questioned him , Peiraeus , famous with the spear , approached leading the stranger , 
Theoclymenus , through the 
city to the gathering place . 
Telemachus did not pause for long before he rose and went to meet them . 
Piraeus it was who was first to speak : �Telemachus , send your women to my house , without delay , to collect Menelaus� gifts to you . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Peiraeus who knows what may happen . if the arrogant 
Suitors murder me behind the closed doors of the house , and split my fathers� wealth between them , I would rather you kept the things yourself to enjoy . if instead it is I who sow the seeds of death for them , bring it all to the palace , and I will share your pleasure . � / 
With this , he guided his long-suffering guest to the house . 
When 
they reached the noble halls , 
they hung their cloaks on bench and chair , and entered the gleaming baths to bathe . 
When the women had washed them , rubbed them with oil , and dressed them in tunics and fleecy cloaks , 
they left the baths and were seated . a maid brought water in a fine golden jug so 
they could rinse their hands , pouring it over their hands into a silver basin . 
Then she brought a gleaming table , and the loyal housekeeper set bread and dishes of meat before them , giving freely of her stores . Telemachus� mother sat opposite by a pillar , leaning from her chair to spin her delicate yarn , while 
they reached for the good food before them . 
When 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , wise 
Penelope was first to speak : �Telemachus , I will go to my room , there to lie down on my bed , that has become a bed of tears indeed , ever since the day when 
Odysseus left for 
Troy with the Atreides . 
It seems you do not care to tell me the truth , though the 
Suitors are absent , as to whether you�ve heard anything of your father�s return . � / �Mother , � wise 
Telemachus answered , �be assured I�ll tell you all . 
We went to 
Pylos , to 
Nestor , the shepherd of his people , who gave me a kind welcome , receiving me in his great palace as a father might welcome his own son back from a distant journey . 
He and his glorious sons were as kind to me as could be . but he�d heard not a word from anyone of brave 
Odysseus , whether living or dead . 
So he sent me on in a well-made horse-drawn chariot , to 
Sparta , to 
Menelaus , the famous warrior , the son of 
Atreus . 
There I met 
Argive 
Helen , for whose sake 
they and the 
Trojans laboured by the gods� will . 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry asked me straight out what I sought in lovely 
Lacedaemon , and I told him the truth . / 
Then he cried out in answer : �Rogues , men without courage , 
they are , who wish to creep into a brave man�s bed . 
Odysseus will bring them to a cruel end , just as if a doe had left twin newborn fawns asleep in some great lion�s lair in the bush , and gone for food on the mountain slopes and in the grassy valleys , and the lion returned to its den and brought them to a cruel end . by 
Father 
Zeus , 
Athene , and 
Apollo , I wish he would come among those 
Suitors with that strength he showed in well-ordered 
Lesbos , when he rose to wrestle with Philomeleides , and threw him mightily , to all the Achaeans� delight . 
Then 
they would meet death swiftly , and a dark wedding . but concerning what you ask of me , I will not evade you , or mislead you : on the contrary , I will not hide a single fact of all that the infallible 
Old man of the 
Sea told me . 
He 
said he saw him shedding great tears in the island haunt of the 
Nymph 
Calypso , who keeps him captive there , far from his native land , since he has no oared ship , no crew , to carry him over the wide waters . � / Those were the words of 
Menelaus , famous warrior , son of 
Atreus . Afterwards I set out for home , and the immortals sent a helpful breeze , and carried me swiftly home . � 
So spoke 
Telemachus , and troubled her heart . / 
Then godlike 
Theoclymenus spoke out too , saying : �Honoured wife of Laertes� son 
Odysseus , 
Menelaus has no true knowledge : but listen to me , and I will prophesy with truth and openness . let 
Zeus above all be my witness , and this welcoming table and hearth of peerless 
Odysseus that I have reached : in truth 
Odysseus has reached this island even now , and waiting or reconnoitring he gains knowledge of their crimes , and sows the seeds of trouble for all those 
Suitors . I noted a bird of omen clearly as I sat on the oared ship , and told 
Telemachus so . � / �Ah , stranger , � wise 
Penelope 
replied , �if only your words should prove true . 
Then you will swiftly know such kindness and gifts from me that all who meet you will call you blessed . � / 
While 
they were speaking , the arrogant 
Suitors were enjoying themselves as usual , hurling the javelin and discus over the flat ground in front of the palace . 
At the dinner hour , when the drovers brought home their flocks from the fields , 
Medon , most popular of the heralds , who was always there at the feasts , 
said : �Now you youngsters have delighted your hearts at your sports , come to the hall so we can prepare the meal : there�s a right time for dining too . � / 
At this , obeying his words , 
they stood , and went towards the royal palace , where 
they threw their cloaks over seats and benches , and prepared the feast by slaughtering well-fed sheep and goats , fatted pigs , and a heifer from the herd . / 
Meanwhile 
Odysseus and the worthy swineherd were making ready to travel to the 
city . 
The master swineherd was first to speak : �Stranger , since you are keen to go to the 
city as my master 
said � as for me I�d rather have left you here to watch the farm , but I respect him and fear he would scold me later , and a master�s rebuke is chastening � well , come , let�s be off . 
The day is nearly done , and you�ll find the evening cold . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �I listen and hear , and you speak to a man who understands you . Let�s go , and you can show me the whole path . but give me a stick to lean on , if you have one trimmed , since you say the track is truly treacherous . � / 
So saying , he slung his wretched torn leather pouch over his shoulder by its twisted strap , and 
Eumaeus gave him a staff that suited him , and off 
they went , leaving the herdsmen and the dogs to guard the farm . 
So the swineherd led his master to the 
city , him leaning on a stick , like a beggar , old and wretched , his body draped in miserable rags . / 
Along the rocky path , near to the 
city , 
they came to a clear , stone-lined spring where the townspeople drew their water . 
Ithacus , 
Neritus and 
Polyctor had dug it , and a grove of water-loving poplars ringed it round . 
The cold water fell from the cliff above , and over the spring 
they had built an altar to the 
Nymphs , where passers-by left offerings . 
There 
they met 
Melanthius , Dolius� son , with his two herdsmen , driving the pick of his she-goats to the Suitors� feast . 
When he set eyes on them he abused them , with a flood of coarse and hostile words , and stirred Odysseus� anger . / �Here comes vice leading vice , indeed ! 
The god matches like with like , as always . 
You miserable swineherd you , tell me I pray where you�re taking this vile pig , a beggarly nuisance that ruins feasts ? He�s no man to whom swords and cauldrons are due . He�s one who�ll scratch his back on every pillar , begging for scraps . if you give him to me to tend the farm , muck out the pens , and hump fodder for the goats , he�d maybe fatten his thighs drinking whey . but since he only knows mischief , he�ll not deign to look for work . He�ll skulk around , and beg , to feed that bottomless gut of his . but I tell you how it will be , for certain , if he reaches noble Odysseus� palace , his ribs will shatter many a footstool hurled at his head by the hands of real men who�ll pelt him through the halls . � / 
With this , the fool barged 
Odysseus as he passed , but failed to knock him from the path . 
Odysseus stood there , unmoved , debating whether to leap at him and beat him to death with his stick , or take him by the ears and thump his head on the ground . 
He endured it however , restraining himself , while the swineherd looked 
Melanthius straight in the eyes , and rebuked him . lifting his hands in prayer 
Eumaeus cried : �Daughters of 
Zeus , 
Nymphs of the 
Fountain , if ever 
Odysseus burned lambs� and kids� thigh-pieces folded in fat on your altars , grant me this wish , that my master might return , with a god to guide to him . 
Then he�d cure you , 
Melanthius , of your insolent ways , roaming arrogantly through the 
city , while useless herdsmen spoil your flock . � / 
The goatherd , 
Melanthius , answered him back . �How the cur whines , bent on mischief ! Some day I�ll take him far from Ithaca , on a black oared ship , and sell him for a price . if only 
Apollo of the 
Silver 
Bow would strike 
Telemachus down in the hall today , or the 
Suitors kill him , as certainly as Odysseus� chance of return has been ended in some far land . � / 
With that he strode past them , as 
they walked slowly on , and quickly came to the royal palace . 
There he went straight in and seated himself among the 
Suitors opposite 
Eurymachus , who of them all liked him most . 
The servants placed meat for him , and the faithful housekeeper brought him bread to eat . / 
When 
Odysseus and the worthy swineherd arrived , 
they halted , with the sound of the lyre ringing in their ears , since 
Phemius was striking the chords of a song for the 
Suitors . 
Odysseus took the swineherd by the arm , saying : �Surely this is Odysseus� house , 
Eumaeus . 
It would be easy to recognise among a thousand . 
There�s building after building . The courtyard wall�s complete with coping , and the gates are well-protected . No one could disregard it . 
And I see the house is full of men feasting : you can smell the meat roasting , and hear the sounds of the lyre that the gods created to accompany a feast . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you 
replied , saying : �
You are quick-witted as always and easily found it out . but now let�s think what to do . You could go first , enter the palace , and join the 
Suitors , while I stay here , or you could stay here if you prefer , and I�ll go on before you . but don�t wait about , if you do , since someone may see you , and hurl something at you , or chastise you . please decide . � / 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus answered : �I listen and hear : you speak to a man who understands you . do you go first , and I will remain behind : I�m used to missiles and blows . 
My heart knows how to suffer , after the pain I�ve endured in war and at sea : just add this to all that�s gone before . but one thing no man can hide is ravening hunger , a cursed plague that brings men plenty of trouble . Oared ships are even launched because of it , bringing evil to enemies on the waves . � / 
So 
they spoke . 
And a dog , lying there , lifted its head and pricked up its ears . argus was the hound of noble 
Odysseus , who had bred him himself , though he sailed to sacred ilium before he could enjoy his company . once the young men used to take the dog out after wild goat , deer and hare , but with his master gone he lay neglected by the gate , among the heaps of mule and cattle dung that Odysseus� men would later use to manure the fields . 
There , plagued by ticks , lay argus the hound . but suddenly aware of 
Odysseus� presence , he wagged his tail and flattened his ears , though no longer strong enough to crawl to his master . Odysseus turned his face aside and hiding it from 
Eumaeus wiped away a tear then quickly 
said : �Eumaeus , it�s strange indeed to see this dog lying in the dung . He�s finely built , but I can�t tell if he had speed to match or was only a dog fed from the table , kept by his master for show . � / 
Then , 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you 
replied : �Yes this dog belongs to a man who has died far away . if he had the form and vigour he had when 
Odysseus left for 
Troy you�d be amazed by the speed and power . 
He was keen-scented on the trail , and no creature he started in the depths of the densest wood escaped him . but now he is in a sad state , and his master has died far from his own country , and the thoughtless women neglect him . 
When their masters aren�t there to command them , servants don�t care about the quality of their work . Far-voiced 
Zeus takes half the good out of them , the day 
they become slaves . � / 
With this he entered the stately house and walking straight into the hall joined the crowd of noble suitors . as for argus , seeing 
Odysseus again in this twentieth year , the hand of dark death seized him . / 
Now , godlike 
Telemachus was the first to notice the swineherd as he entered the hall , and with a nod he called him swiftly to his side . 
Eumaeus looked round then picked up a stool nearby , where the carver sat when slicing the joints of meat for the 
Suitors at the feast . 
He took the stool and set it down at Telemachus� table , opposite him , then seated himself there . a steward brought him a portion of meat , and helped him to bread from a basket . / 
Odysseus entered close on Eumaeus� heels , in his beggar�s disguise , looking old and wretched , leaning on his staff , and clothed in miserable rags . 
He sat down on the ash wood sill of the doorway , leaning on the doorpost made of cypress that had been carefully planed and trued to the line by some carpenter of old . / 
Telemachus called the swineherd , and taking a whole loaf from the fine bread basket , then adding as much meat as his hands could hold , he spoke to him , saying : �Take this food to the stranger , and tell him to do the round of the 
Suitors one by one , as well . 
It doesn�t do for a man in need to be shy . � / 
At this , the swineherd went over to 
Odysseus , and as he approached him spoke with winged words : �Stranger , this is from 
Telemachus , who suggests you do the round of the 
Suitors one by one , and says that a man in need should not be shy . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus spoke in return : �Lord 
Zeus , I pray , grant that 
Telemachus may be blessed among men , and receive all that his heart desires . � 
Then he took the food with both hands and set it down in front of him on his shabby leather bag . 
While the minstrel sang in the hall he ate , and ended his meal as the bard was finishing the song , whereupon the 
Suitors filled the hall with their noise . 
Now 
Athene appeared at Odysseus� side , close to that son of 
Laertes , and prompted him to go and gather scraps among the 
Suitors , and find out which were decent men and which were wild , not that she meant to save a single one from death . 
So round he went , starting on the right , proffering his hand on every side like a true beggar . 
They wondered who he was , and asked each other where he had come from , giving him food out of pity . / 
Then up spoke 
Melanthius the goatherd : �Suitors to our noble queen hear me on the subject of this stranger , since I�ve seen him before . 
The swineherd brought him here , though I don�t know for sure what native country he claims . � / 
At this , 
Antinous rounded on the swineherd : �Eumaeus , the famous , why on earth did you drag this fellow here ? Haven�t we vagrants enough already , beggarly nuisances to ruin our feasts ? Isn�t it enough for you that 
they all crowd in here , swallowing your master�s stores , without you inviting this wretch too ? � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered him then : �Antinous , noble as you are your words sound ill . 
Who searches out foreigners himself , and invites them home , unless 
they are masters of some universal art : a seer , or physician , or architect , or perhaps a divine minstrel who delights men with song ? 
Such men are welcome throughout the boundless earth , but no one would invite a burdensome beggar . 
You are the harshest 
Suitor where Odysseus� servants are concerned , harshest of all to me : but I don�t care as long as loyal 
Penelope , my lady , and godlike 
Telemachus live here . � / but wise 
Telemachus spoke to him : �Silence now : don�t waste words answering 
Antinous : it�s ever his way to employ harsh language and with trouble in mind stir men to anger , encouraging others to do the same . � / 
He added winged words for 
Antinous himself : �
Antinous you show your concern for me indeed , like a father for a son , advising me to drive that stranger by force of words from the palace . No , no , may the gods forbid such a thing . Give him some food yourself , since I don�t begrudge it , but tell you to do so , rather , paying no attention to my mother , or any of the servants in Odysseus� palace . but you are minded quite differently in truth , preferring to dine yourself rather than give to another . � / �Telemachus , � Antinous retorted , �brave spirit and noble orator , what are you saying ? if every 
Suitor gave him as much as I would , he�d avoid this house for a full three months . � 
And with that he snatched up a stool from under the table where it stood , the one he propped his bright-sandaled feet on during the feast , and flourished it . 
Nevertheless all the others gave something , and 
Odysseus filled his leather pouch with scraps of bread and meat . 
Odysseus was heading back to the threshold having sounded out the 
Achaeans scot-free , when he paused near 
Antinous and spoke to him : �Give me something , 
Friend , since you seem to me the best and not the least of the 
Achaeans here . 
You look every inch a king , and therefore it is right you should give me a better portion than the others and I will sound your name throughout the boundless earth . I too once had a house of my own among men . I too lived in riches in a fine palace , and often gave gifts to the stranger , whoever he might be , whatever his needs were . I had servants too without number , and an abundance of all that counts as wealth and allows a man to live well . / but 
Zeus the son of 
Cronos ended that � such was his pleasure � when he prompted me to my ruin , sailing the long voyage to 
Egypt , as a wandering corsair . 
There in the 
Nile I moored my curved ships . 
Then I told my loyal companions to stay and guard them , while I sent scouts to find the highest ground . but my crews , feeling confident , and succumbing to temptation , set about plundering the Egyptians� fine fields , carrying off women and children , and killing the men till their cries reached the 
city . 
Hearing the shouting the people poured out at dawn and filled the plain with infantry , and chariots , and the gleam of bronze . 
Zeus who hurls the lightning bolt filled my men with abject fear , and not one had the courage to face the enemy who threatened us on all sides , or hold his ground . 
Then 
they killed many of us with their bronze weapons , and dragged the rest off to the 
city as slaves . as for myself , 
they handed me over to a friend of theirs , 
Dmetor son of 
Iasus , mighty ruler of 
Cyprus , who took me there , and from there I reached here , in much distress . � / �What god is it , � 
Antinous 
said , �who brings this creature here to blight our feast ? 
Get away from my table , stand over there in the middle , you insolent and shameless beggar , lest you end up in a place more bitter than 
Egypt or 
Cyprus . 
Every man in turn you try will no doubt give to you without conscience or restraint , since there�s never a thought of holding back when there�s plenty to hand , and they�re making free with another man�s wealth . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus drew back and answered : �How�s this ? 
It seems your brains don�t match your looks ! if you can�t bring yourself to break off a piece of bread , when there�s plenty here , and give it to a suppliant at another man�s table , is it likely you would give even a grain of salt from your own ? � / 
At this , 
Antinous glowered , angered the more , and spoke winged words with a dark look : �Now you�re truly casting aspersions I doubt you�ll get out of this hall unscathed . � / 
And with that he grasped the stool and threw it , striking 
Odysseus on his back , under the right shoulder . but 
Odysseus stood firm as a rock , and did not reel at the blow . 
He merely shook his head in silence , thinking dark thoughts in the depths of his mind . 
Then he returned to the threshold , sat down with his well-filled bag , and addressed the 
Suitors . / �Hear me , you 
Suitors of the noble 
Queen , while I say what my heart feels . 
When a man is struck , fighting for his own possessions , his cattle or his white sheep , there�s no reason for shame or grief : but 
Antinous� blow was on account of my ravening hunger , a cursed plague that brings men plenty of trouble . if there are gods and furies even for beggars let 
Antinous find death before he can marry . � / Antinous , Eupeithes� son , retorted : �Stranger , sit quiet and eat , or go elsewhere , lest the young men drag you by hand or foot through the house , and scrape off all your skin . � / 
Such were his words , but the others were indignant , and one proud youth 
said : �Antinous , you were wrong to strike at a wretched vagrant . 
What if he chanced to be some god from heaven ? You�d be a doomed man . 
The gods put on all kinds of disguises , and in the form of wandering strangers do indeed visit our cities observing human virtue and vice . � / 
So the 
Suitors murmured , but 
Antinous ignored their words , and though 
Telemachus nursed great grief in his heart at the blow to his father , he shed not a tear , but shook his head in silence , thinking dark thoughts in the depths of his mind . / but wise 
Penelope , hearing of Antinous� striking the beggar in the hall , cried out so her handmaids heard : �I hope 
Apollo the keen archer strikes you in the same way ! � 
And her housekeeper , 
Eurynome , added : �If only our prayers might be fulfilled , not one of those men would see the 
Dawn , golden-throned . � / �Nurse , � wise 
Penelope 
replied , �they are all hateful , plotting evil but 
Antinous above all is a man dark as death . See now , when a wretched beggar goes through the hall asking alms out of need while all the rest fill his bag generously 
Antinous hurls a stool at his back and strikes him on the shoulder . � / 
While she sat in her room talking with her maids , noble 
Odysseus was eating his meal . 
Penelope then summoned her loyal swineherd , and 
said to him : �Worthy 
Eumaeus , go and ask the stranger to come to me , so I can welcome him and ask if he has seen or heard anything of my steadfast 
Odysseus . 
He has the look of a much-travelled man . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered her , saying : �My 
Queen , I only wish the 
Achaeans would cease their noise , since his speech is entrancing . 
He stumbled upon me first after he�d escaped from a ship by stealth . Three days and nights he stayed with me in the hut , but even then the story of his sufferings was incomplete . Sitting in my house , he held me entranced , like a man gazing at a bard who sings songs of longing the gods have taught him , to mortal ears . 
He claims he is an old family friend of 
Odysseus , and hails from 
Crete where Minos� people live . 
He arrived here in his wandering far from that island , always dogged by suffering . 
And he swears he has heard news of 
Odysseus , that he is alive and nearby in the rich 
Thesprotian country , and is bringing home a fortune in treasure . � / �Go and summon him here , � 
said wise 
Penelope , �so that he can tell me so , face to face . as for those 
Suitors , let them have their sport , outside or in the hall below , light-hearted because their own stores of bread and mellow wine are safe at home with only their servants to taste them , while 
they crowd our house day after day , killing our sheep and oxen and well-fed goats , feasting and wasting our glowing wine : squandering our wealth , because there is no 
Odysseus here to stave off ruin . but if 
Odysseus comes home to his own country , he and our son will take revenge on these men for their rapacity . � / as she finished , 
Telemachus sneezed loudly in the echoing hall , and 
Penelope laughed , and 
said to 
Eumaeus with winged words : �Go , please , and summon the stranger to me . 
You see my son sneezed at my words ? 
So will death strike the 
Suitors , every man , not one will escape their fate . 
And remember this that I say as well : if I find that he speaks the truth I will fit him out in handsome clothes , a tunic and a cloak . � / 
Hearing this promise , the swineherd went to find 
Odysseus , and spoke aloud to him with winged words : �Old man , wise 
Penelope , the mother of 
Telemachus , wishes to see you . 
Sorrowful as she is , her heart prompts her to ask for news of her husband . if she finds that you speak the truth , she will give you what you need most , a tunic and cloak , since as for food you can beg throughout the island to feed your belly , and anyone will give it to you . � / noble long-suffering 
Odysseus answered : �Eumaeus , I will tell the whole truth to wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , shortly . I know all about 
Odysseus : he and I have suffered alike . but I fear this harsh crowd of 
Suitors , whose violence and irreverence reaches the adamantine heavens . 
Just now when that man struck me a blow and hurt me , as I wandered harmlessly round the hall , no one including 
Telemachus did a thing to prevent it . 
So ask 
Penelope , even though she is eager to see me , to wait until sunset darkens the hall , then she can give me a seat nearer the fire and ask me about her husband and his homecoming , for my clothes are ragged as you know , you whom I first asked for help . � / 
Hearing this , the swineherd returned , and as he entered the room , 
Penelope 
said : �Eumaeus , you fail to bring him here . 
What does the stranger mean by it ? Is he more afraid than he should be of something , or does he hesitate for some other reason ? a shy beggar makes a poor one . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered her then , saying : �He is right , anyone would agree , in wanting to avoid the insolence of arrogant men . 
So he asks you to wait till sunset , which is a more fitting time for you too , my 
Queen , to speak to a stranger alone , and hear what he has to say . � / 
Wise 
Penelope answered : �The stranger is not devoid of judgement in guessing how things might be , since I don�t believe there are any men on earth who plot such wicked and insolent games as these men do . � / 
When she had finished speaking , and he had 
said all he had to say , the worthy swineherd left to rejoin the crowd of 
Suitors . 
At once he sought 
Telemachus , and holding his head close whispered winged words to him in secret : �Dear master , I will go and protect the farm and the pigs , your livelihood and mine . 
You must be in command here . 
Above all consider your own safety , be alert for any threat against you , since many of the 
Achaeans are planning evil . 
And may 
Zeus destroy them before 
they can strike at us . / �May it be so , old 
Friend , have your supper and go . Return in the morning with some fine animals for the slaughter . Leave all here in my hands and the gods� . � / 
At this the swineherd seated himself again on the gleaming bench , and when he had quenched his hunger and thirst , he went off to the farm , leaving the courts and halls filled with the revellers , who were enjoying the dancing and singing now that evening had fallen . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , godlike Odysseus� steadfast son 
Telemachus , eager to leave for the 
city , strapped on his fine sandals , picked up his sturdy spear , one comfortable to hold , and 
said to the swineherd : �Old friend , I�m off to town to find my mother : she won�t stop her sad weeping , her tearful grieving , till she sees me in the flesh . 
Here are my orders for you . guide this unfortunate stranger to the 
city , so he can beg for food there : someone may decide to give him a crust and a cup of water . 
With all my troubles I can�t bear everyone�s burden myself . 
So much the worse for him if that should make him genuinely angry . I would rather speak the truth . � / 
Then resourceful 
Odysseus spoke up , saying : �Friend , I no more wish to be left here myself . It�s better for a beggar to beg in town than in the country : someone may decide to give me food . I�m too old to live on a farm at some master�s beck and call . Go ahead , and this man will take me there as you command , when I�ve warmed myself at the fire and the sun has some heat , since the rags I wear are wretchedly thin , and I fear the morning frost might prove too much for me , given that you tell me it�s a long walk to town . � / 
At this , 
Telemachus strode off quickly through the farm , planning disaster for the 
Suitors . 
When he reached the royal palace , he leant his spear against a tall pillar , and crossed the stone threshold . / 
The nurse , 
Eurycleia , who was spreading fleecy covers on the fine-wrought chairs , was first to see him . She rushed towards him , in floods of tears , while noble Odysseus� other maids gathered round him , welcoming him lovingly with kisses on head and shoulders . / 
Soon wise 
Penelope , the image of Artemis or golden 
Aphrodite , came from her room , and weeping threw her arms round her dear son , kissing his face and his fine eyes , and sobbed out winged words : �Telemachus , light of my eyes , here you are . I thought I would never see you again when you left in your ship for 
Pylos to seek news of your brave father , secretly and against my wishes . Come tell me what news you have of him . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Mother , don�t rouse my tears , don�t stir my emotions : I�ve barely escaped from total ruin . 
Bathe , and dress yourself in clean linen , then go to your room upstairs with your women , and promise the gods a perfect offering , hoping that 
Zeus might bring about a day of judgement . I will go to the gathering place and invite a guest to our house , a stranger who returned from 
Pylos with me . I sent him on ahead with my noble friends , and told Peiraeus to take him home and welcome him , and show him kindness and honour till I came . � / To these words of his she made no reply , but went and bathed , and dressed in clean linen , and promised the gods a perfect offering , hoping that 
Zeus might bring about a day of judgement . / 
Then 
Telemachus , spear in hand , with two swift hounds at his heels , left by way of the hall . 
And 
Athene granted him such miraculous grace that every face turned to him in wonder as he passed . 
The noble 
Suitors crowded round him speaking words of respect while plotting evil in the depths of their hearts . but he evaded the dense throng , and took his place alongside mentor , 
Antiphus and 
Halitherses , his father�s friends of old . as 
they questioned him , Peiraeus , famous with the spear , approached leading the stranger , 
Theoclymenus , through the 
city to the gathering place . 
Telemachus did not pause for long before he rose and went to meet them . 
Piraeus it was who was first to speak : �Telemachus , send your women to my house , without delay , to collect Menelaus� gifts to you . � / 
Wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Peiraeus who knows what may happen . if the arrogant 
Suitors murder me behind the closed doors of the house , and split my fathers� wealth between them , I would rather you kept the things yourself to enjoy . if instead it is I who sow the seeds of death for them , bring it all to the palace , and I will share your pleasure . � / 
With this , he guided his long-suffering guest to the house . 
When 
they reached the noble halls , 
they hung their cloaks on bench and chair , and entered the gleaming baths to bathe . 
When the women had washed them , rubbed them with oil , and dressed them in tunics and fleecy cloaks , 
they left the baths and were seated . a maid brought water in a fine golden jug so 
they could rinse their hands , pouring it over their hands into a silver basin . 
Then she brought a gleaming table , and the loyal housekeeper set bread and dishes of meat before them , giving freely of her stores . Telemachus� mother sat opposite by a pillar , leaning from her chair to spin her delicate yarn , while 
they reached for the good food before them . 
When 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , wise 
Penelope was first to speak : �Telemachus , I will go to my room , there to lie down on my bed , that has become a bed of tears indeed , ever since the day when 
Odysseus left for 
Troy with the Atreides . 
It seems you do not care to tell me the truth , though the 
Suitors are absent , as to whether you�ve heard anything of your father�s return . � / �Mother , � wise 
Telemachus answered , �be assured I�ll tell you all . 
We went to 
Pylos , to 
Nestor , the shepherd of his people , who gave me a kind welcome , receiving me in his great palace as a father might welcome his own son back from a distant journey . 
He and his glorious sons were as kind to me as could be . but he�d heard not a word from anyone of brave 
Odysseus , whether living or dead . 
So he sent me on in a well-made horse-drawn chariot , to 
Sparta , to 
Menelaus , the famous warrior , the son of 
Atreus . 
There I met 
Argive 
Helen , for whose sake 
they and the 
Trojans laboured by the gods� will . 
Menelaus of the loud war-cry asked me straight out what I sought in lovely 
Lacedaemon , and I told him the truth . / 
Then he cried out in answer : �Rogues , men without courage , 
they are , who wish to creep into a brave man�s bed . 
Odysseus will bring them to a cruel end , just as if a doe had left twin newborn fawns asleep in some great lion�s lair in the bush , and gone for food on the mountain slopes and in the grassy valleys , and the lion returned to its den and brought them to a cruel end . by 
Father 
Zeus , 
Athene , and 
Apollo , I wish he would come among those 
Suitors with that strength he showed in well-ordered 
Lesbos , when he rose to wrestle with Philomeleides , and threw him mightily , to all the Achaeans� delight . 
Then 
they would meet death swiftly , and a dark wedding . but concerning what you ask of me , I will not evade you , or mislead you : on the contrary , I will not hide a single fact of all that the infallible 
Old man of the 
Sea told me . 
He 
said he saw him shedding great tears in the island haunt of the 
Nymph 
Calypso , who keeps him captive there , far from his native land , since he has no oared ship , no crew , to carry him over the wide waters . � / Those were the words of 
Menelaus , famous warrior , son of 
Atreus . Afterwards I set out for home , and the immortals sent a helpful breeze , and carried me swiftly home . � 
So spoke 
Telemachus , and troubled her heart . / 
Then godlike 
Theoclymenus spoke out too , saying : �Honoured wife of Laertes� son 
Odysseus , 
Menelaus has no true knowledge : but listen to me , and I will prophesy with truth and openness . let 
Zeus above all be my witness , and this welcoming table and hearth of peerless 
Odysseus that I have reached : in truth 
Odysseus has reached this island even now , and waiting or reconnoitring he gains knowledge of their crimes , and sows the seeds of trouble for all those 
Suitors . I noted a bird of omen clearly as I sat on the oared ship , and told 
Telemachus so . � / �Ah , stranger , � wise 
Penelope 
replied , �if only your words should prove true . 
Then you will swiftly know such kindness and gifts from me that all who meet you will call you blessed . � / 
While 
they were speaking , the arrogant 
Suitors were enjoying themselves as usual , hurling the javelin and discus over the flat ground in front of the palace . 
At the dinner hour , when the drovers brought home their flocks from the fields , 
Medon , most popular of the heralds , who was always there at the feasts , 
said : �Now you youngsters have delighted your hearts at your sports , come to the hall so we can prepare the meal : there�s a right time for dining too . � / 
At this , obeying his words , 
they stood , and went towards the royal palace , where 
they threw their cloaks over seats and benches , and prepared the feast by slaughtering well-fed sheep and goats , fatted pigs , and a heifer from the herd . / 
Meanwhile 
Odysseus and the worthy swineherd were making ready to travel to the 
city . 
The master swineherd was first to speak : �Stranger , since you are keen to go to the 
city as my master 
said � as for me I�d rather have left you here to watch the farm , but I respect him and fear he would scold me later , and a master�s rebuke is chastening � well , come , let�s be off . 
The day is nearly done , and you�ll find the evening cold . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �I listen and hear , and you speak to a man who understands you . Let�s go , and you can show me the whole path . but give me a stick to lean on , if you have one trimmed , since you say the track is truly treacherous . � / 
So saying , he slung his wretched torn leather pouch over his shoulder by its twisted strap , and 
Eumaeus gave him a staff that suited him , and off 
they went , leaving the herdsmen and the dogs to guard the farm . 
So the swineherd led his master to the 
city , him leaning on a stick , like a beggar , old and wretched , his body draped in miserable rags . / 
Along the rocky path , near to the 
city , 
they came to a clear , stone-lined spring where the townspeople drew their water . 
Ithacus , 
Neritus and 
Polyctor had dug it , and a grove of water-loving poplars ringed it round . 
The cold water fell from the cliff above , and over the spring 
they had built an altar to the 
Nymphs , where passers-by left offerings . 
There 
they met 
Melanthius , Dolius� son , with his two herdsmen , driving the pick of his she-goats to the Suitors� feast . 
When he set eyes on them he abused them , with a flood of coarse and hostile words , and stirred Odysseus� anger . / �Here comes vice leading vice , indeed ! 
The god matches like with like , as always . 
You miserable swineherd you , tell me I pray where you�re taking this vile pig , a beggarly nuisance that ruins feasts ? He�s no man to whom swords and cauldrons are due . He�s one who�ll scratch his back on every pillar , begging for scraps . if you give him to me to tend the farm , muck out the pens , and hump fodder for the goats , he�d maybe fatten his thighs drinking whey . but since he only knows mischief , he�ll not deign to look for work . He�ll skulk around , and beg , to feed that bottomless gut of his . but I tell you how it will be , for certain , if he reaches noble Odysseus� palace , his ribs will shatter many a footstool hurled at his head by the hands of real men who�ll pelt him through the halls . � / 
With this , the fool barged 
Odysseus as he passed , but failed to knock him from the path . 
Odysseus stood there , unmoved , debating whether to leap at him and beat him to death with his stick , or take him by the ears and thump his head on the ground . 
He endured it however , restraining himself , while the swineherd looked 
Melanthius straight in the eyes , and rebuked him . lifting his hands in prayer 
Eumaeus cried : �Daughters of 
Zeus , 
Nymphs of the 
Fountain , if ever 
Odysseus burned lambs� and kids� thigh-pieces folded in fat on your altars , grant me this wish , that my master might return , with a god to guide to him . 
Then he�d cure you , 
Melanthius , of your insolent ways , roaming arrogantly through the 
city , while useless herdsmen spoil your flock . � / 
The goatherd , 
Melanthius , answered him back . �How the cur whines , bent on mischief ! Some day I�ll take him far from Ithaca , on a black oared ship , and sell him for a price . if only 
Apollo of the 
Silver 
Bow would strike 
Telemachus down in the hall today , or the 
Suitors kill him , as certainly as Odysseus� chance of return has been ended in some far land . � / 
With that he strode past them , as 
they walked slowly on , and quickly came to the royal palace . 
There he went straight in and seated himself among the 
Suitors opposite 
Eurymachus , who of them all liked him most . 
The servants placed meat for him , and the faithful housekeeper brought him bread to eat . / 
When 
Odysseus and the worthy swineherd arrived , 
they halted , with the sound of the lyre ringing in their ears , since 
Phemius was striking the chords of a song for the 
Suitors . 
Odysseus took the swineherd by the arm , saying : �Surely this is Odysseus� house , 
Eumaeus . 
It would be easy to recognise among a thousand . 
There�s building after building . The courtyard wall�s complete with coping , and the gates are well-protected . No one could disregard it . 
And I see the house is full of men feasting : you can smell the meat roasting , and hear the sounds of the lyre that the gods created to accompany a feast . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you 
replied , saying : �
You are quick-witted as always and easily found it out . but now let�s think what to do . You could go first , enter the palace , and join the 
Suitors , while I stay here , or you could stay here if you prefer , and I�ll go on before you . but don�t wait about , if you do , since someone may see you , and hurl something at you , or chastise you . please decide . � / 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus answered : �I listen and hear : you speak to a man who understands you . do you go first , and I will remain behind : I�m used to missiles and blows . 
My heart knows how to suffer , after the pain I�ve endured in war and at sea : just add this to all that�s gone before . but one thing no man can hide is ravening hunger , a cursed plague that brings men plenty of trouble . Oared ships are even launched because of it , bringing evil to enemies on the waves . � / 
So 
they spoke . 
And a dog , lying there , lifted its head and pricked up its ears . argus was the hound of noble 
Odysseus , who had bred him himself , though he sailed to sacred ilium before he could enjoy his company . once the young men used to take the dog out after wild goat , deer and hare , but with his master gone he lay neglected by the gate , among the heaps of mule and cattle dung that Odysseus� men would later use to manure the fields . 
There , plagued by ticks , lay argus the hound . but suddenly aware of 
Odysseus� presence , he wagged his tail and flattened his ears , though no longer strong enough to crawl to his master . Odysseus turned his face aside and hiding it from 
Eumaeus wiped away a tear then quickly 
said : �Eumaeus , it�s strange indeed to see this dog lying in the dung . He�s finely built , but I can�t tell if he had speed to match or was only a dog fed from the table , kept by his master for show . � / 
Then , 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you 
replied : �Yes this dog belongs to a man who has died far away . if he had the form and vigour he had when 
Odysseus left for 
Troy you�d be amazed by the speed and power . 
He was keen-scented on the trail , and no creature he started in the depths of the densest wood escaped him . but now he is in a sad state , and his master has died far from his own country , and the thoughtless women neglect him . 
When their masters aren�t there to command them , servants don�t care about the quality of their work . Far-voiced 
Zeus takes half the good out of them , the day 
they become slaves . � / 
With this he entered the stately house and walking straight into the hall joined the crowd of noble suitors . as for argus , seeing 
Odysseus again in this twentieth year , the hand of dark death seized him . / 
Now , godlike 
Telemachus was the first to notice the swineherd as he entered the hall , and with a nod he called him swiftly to his side . 
Eumaeus looked round then picked up a stool nearby , where the carver sat when slicing the joints of meat for the 
Suitors at the feast . 
He took the stool and set it down at Telemachus� table , opposite him , then seated himself there . a steward brought him a portion of meat , and helped him to bread from a basket . / 
Odysseus entered close on Eumaeus� heels , in his beggar�s disguise , looking old and wretched , leaning on his staff , and clothed in miserable rags . 
He sat down on the ash wood sill of the doorway , leaning on the doorpost made of cypress that had been carefully planed and trued to the line by some carpenter of old . / 
Telemachus called the swineherd , and taking a whole loaf from the fine bread basket , then adding as much meat as his hands could hold , he spoke to him , saying : �Take this food to the stranger , and tell him to do the round of the 
Suitors one by one , as well . 
It doesn�t do for a man in need to be shy . � / 
At this , the swineherd went over to 
Odysseus , and as he approached him spoke with winged words : �Stranger , this is from 
Telemachus , who suggests you do the round of the 
Suitors one by one , and says that a man in need should not be shy . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus spoke in return : �Lord 
Zeus , I pray , grant that 
Telemachus may be blessed among men , and receive all that his heart desires . � 
Then he took the food with both hands and set it down in front of him on his shabby leather bag . 
While the minstrel sang in the hall he ate , and ended his meal as the bard was finishing the song , whereupon the 
Suitors filled the hall with their noise . 
Now 
Athene appeared at Odysseus� side , close to that son of 
Laertes , and prompted him to go and gather scraps among the 
Suitors , and find out which were decent men and which were wild , not that she meant to save a single one from death . 
So round he went , starting on the right , proffering his hand on every side like a true beggar . 
They wondered who he was , and asked each other where he had come from , giving him food out of pity . / 
Then up spoke 
Melanthius the goatherd : �Suitors to our noble queen hear me on the subject of this stranger , since I�ve seen him before . 
The swineherd brought him here , though I don�t know for sure what native country he claims . � / 
At this , 
Antinous rounded on the swineherd : �Eumaeus , the famous , why on earth did you drag this fellow here ? Haven�t we vagrants enough already , beggarly nuisances to ruin our feasts ? Isn�t it enough for you that 
they all crowd in here , swallowing your master�s stores , without you inviting this wretch too ? � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered him then : �Antinous , noble as you are your words sound ill . 
Who searches out foreigners himself , and invites them home , unless 
they are masters of some universal art : a seer , or physician , or architect , or perhaps a divine minstrel who delights men with song ? 
Such men are welcome throughout the boundless earth , but no one would invite a burdensome beggar . 
You are the harshest 
Suitor where Odysseus� servants are concerned , harshest of all to me : but I don�t care as long as loyal 
Penelope , my lady , and godlike 
Telemachus live here . � / but wise 
Telemachus spoke to him : �Silence now : don�t waste words answering 
Antinous : it�s ever his way to employ harsh language and with trouble in mind stir men to anger , encouraging others to do the same . � / 
He added winged words for 
Antinous himself : �
Antinous you show your concern for me indeed , like a father for a son , advising me to drive that stranger by force of words from the palace . No , no , may the gods forbid such a thing . Give him some food yourself , since I don�t begrudge it , but tell you to do so , rather , paying no attention to my mother , or any of the servants in Odysseus� palace . but you are minded quite differently in truth , preferring to dine yourself rather than give to another . � / �Telemachus , � Antinous retorted , �brave spirit and noble orator , what are you saying ? if every 
Suitor gave him as much as I would , he�d avoid this house for a full three months . � 
And with that he snatched up a stool from under the table where it stood , the one he propped his bright-sandaled feet on during the feast , and flourished it . 
Nevertheless all the others gave something , and 
Odysseus filled his leather pouch with scraps of bread and meat . 
Odysseus was heading back to the threshold having sounded out the 
Achaeans scot-free , when he paused near 
Antinous and spoke to him : �Give me something , 
Friend , since you seem to me the best and not the least of the 
Achaeans here . 
You look every inch a king , and therefore it is right you should give me a better portion than the others and I will sound your name throughout the boundless earth . I too once had a house of my own among men . I too lived in riches in a fine palace , and often gave gifts to the stranger , whoever he might be , whatever his needs were . I had servants too without number , and an abundance of all that counts as wealth and allows a man to live well . / but 
Zeus the son of 
Cronos ended that � such was his pleasure � when he prompted me to my ruin , sailing the long voyage to 
Egypt , as a wandering corsair . 
There in the 
Nile I moored my curved ships . 
Then I told my loyal companions to stay and guard them , while I sent scouts to find the highest ground . but my crews , feeling confident , and succumbing to temptation , set about plundering the Egyptians� fine fields , carrying off women and children , and killing the men till their cries reached the 
city . 
Hearing the shouting the people poured out at dawn and filled the plain with infantry , and chariots , and the gleam of bronze . 
Zeus who hurls the lightning bolt filled my men with abject fear , and not one had the courage to face the enemy who threatened us on all sides , or hold his ground . 
Then 
they killed many of us with their bronze weapons , and dragged the rest off to the 
city as slaves . as for myself , 
they handed me over to a friend of theirs , 
Dmetor son of 
Iasus , mighty ruler of 
Cyprus , who took me there , and from there I reached here , in much distress . � / �What god is it , � 
Antinous 
said , �who brings this creature here to blight our feast ? 
Get away from my table , stand over there in the middle , you insolent and shameless beggar , lest you end up in a place more bitter than 
Egypt or 
Cyprus . 
Every man in turn you try will no doubt give to you without conscience or restraint , since there�s never a thought of holding back when there�s plenty to hand , and they�re making free with another man�s wealth . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus drew back and answered : �How�s this ? 
It seems your brains don�t match your looks ! if you can�t bring yourself to break off a piece of bread , when there�s plenty here , and give it to a suppliant at another man�s table , is it likely you would give even a grain of salt from your own ? � / 
At this , 
Antinous glowered , angered the more , and spoke winged words with a dark look : �Now you�re truly casting aspersions I doubt you�ll get out of this hall unscathed . � / 
And with that he grasped the stool and threw it , striking 
Odysseus on his back , under the right shoulder . but 
Odysseus stood firm as a rock , and did not reel at the blow . 
He merely shook his head in silence , thinking dark thoughts in the depths of his mind . 
Then he returned to the threshold , sat down with his well-filled bag , and addressed the 
Suitors . / �Hear me , you 
Suitors of the noble 
Queen , while I say what my heart feels . 
When a man is struck , fighting for his own possessions , his cattle or his white sheep , there�s no reason for shame or grief : but 
Antinous� blow was on account of my ravening hunger , a cursed plague that brings men plenty of trouble . if there are gods and furies even for beggars let 
Antinous find death before he can marry . � / Antinous , Eupeithes� son , retorted : �Stranger , sit quiet and eat , or go elsewhere , lest the young men drag you by hand or foot through the house , and scrape off all your skin . � / 
Such were his words , but the others were indignant , and one proud youth 
said : �Antinous , you were wrong to strike at a wretched vagrant . 
What if he chanced to be some god from heaven ? You�d be a doomed man . 
The gods put on all kinds of disguises , and in the form of wandering strangers do indeed visit our cities observing human virtue and vice . � / 
So the 
Suitors murmured , but 
Antinous ignored their words , and though 
Telemachus nursed great grief in his heart at the blow to his father , he shed not a tear , but shook his head in silence , thinking dark thoughts in the depths of his mind . / but wise 
Penelope , hearing of Antinous� striking the beggar in the hall , cried out so her handmaids heard : �I hope 
Apollo the keen archer strikes you in the same way ! � 
And her housekeeper , 
Eurynome , added : �If only our prayers might be fulfilled , not one of those men would see the 
Dawn , golden-throned . � / �Nurse , � wise 
Penelope 
replied , �they are all hateful , plotting evil but 
Antinous above all is a man dark as death . See now , when a wretched beggar goes through the hall asking alms out of need while all the rest fill his bag generously 
Antinous hurls a stool at his back and strikes him on the shoulder . � / 
While she sat in her room talking with her maids , noble 
Odysseus was eating his meal . 
Penelope then summoned her loyal swineherd , and 
said to him : �Worthy 
Eumaeus , go and ask the stranger to come to me , so I can welcome him and ask if he has seen or heard anything of my steadfast 
Odysseus . 
He has the look of a much-travelled man . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered her , saying : �My 
Queen , I only wish the 
Achaeans would cease their noise , since his speech is entrancing . 
He stumbled upon me first after he�d escaped from a ship by stealth . Three days and nights he stayed with me in the hut , but even then the story of his sufferings was incomplete . Sitting in my house , he held me entranced , like a man gazing at a bard who sings songs of longing the gods have taught him , to mortal ears . 
He claims he is an old family friend of 
Odysseus , and hails from 
Crete where Minos� people live . 
He arrived here in his wandering far from that island , always dogged by suffering . 
And he swears he has heard news of 
Odysseus , that he is alive and nearby in the rich 
Thesprotian country , and is bringing home a fortune in treasure . � / �Go and summon him here , � 
said wise 
Penelope , �so that he can tell me so , face to face . as for those 
Suitors , let them have their sport , outside or in the hall below , light-hearted because their own stores of bread and mellow wine are safe at home with only their servants to taste them , while 
they crowd our house day after day , killing our sheep and oxen and well-fed goats , feasting and wasting our glowing wine : squandering our wealth , because there is no 
Odysseus here to stave off ruin . but if 
Odysseus comes home to his own country , he and our son will take revenge on these men for their rapacity . � / as she finished , 
Telemachus sneezed loudly in the echoing hall , and 
Penelope laughed , and 
said to 
Eumaeus with winged words : �Go , please , and summon the stranger to me . 
You see my son sneezed at my words ? 
So will death strike the 
Suitors , every man , not one will escape their fate . 
And remember this that I say as well : if I find that he speaks the truth I will fit him out in handsome clothes , a tunic and a cloak . � / 
Hearing this promise , the swineherd went to find 
Odysseus , and spoke aloud to him with winged words : �Old man , wise 
Penelope , the mother of 
Telemachus , wishes to see you . 
Sorrowful as she is , her heart prompts her to ask for news of her husband . if she finds that you speak the truth , she will give you what you need most , a tunic and cloak , since as for food you can beg throughout the island to feed your belly , and anyone will give it to you . � / noble long-suffering 
Odysseus answered : �Eumaeus , I will tell the whole truth to wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , shortly . I know all about 
Odysseus : he and I have suffered alike . but I fear this harsh crowd of 
Suitors , whose violence and irreverence reaches the adamantine heavens . 
Just now when that man struck me a blow and hurt me , as I wandered harmlessly round the hall , no one including 
Telemachus did a thing to prevent it . 
So ask 
Penelope , even though she is eager to see me , to wait until sunset darkens the hall , then she can give me a seat nearer the fire and ask me about her husband and his homecoming , for my clothes are ragged as you know , you whom I first asked for help . � / 
Hearing this , the swineherd returned , and as he entered the room , 
Penelope 
said : �Eumaeus , you fail to bring him here . 
What does the stranger mean by it ? Is he more afraid than he should be of something , or does he hesitate for some other reason ? a shy beggar makes a poor one . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered her then , saying : �He is right , anyone would agree , in wanting to avoid the insolence of arrogant men . 
So he asks you to wait till sunset , which is a more fitting time for you too , my 
Queen , to speak to a stranger alone , and hear what he has to say . � / 
Wise 
Penelope answered : �The stranger is not devoid of judgement in guessing how things might be , since I don�t believe there are any men on earth who plot such wicked and insolent games as these men do . � / 
When she had finished speaking , and he had 
said all he had to say , the worthy swineherd left to rejoin the crowd of 
Suitors . 
At once he sought 
Telemachus , and holding his head close whispered winged words to him in secret : �Dear master , I will go and protect the farm and the pigs , your livelihood and mine . 
You must be in command here . 
Above all consider your own safety , be alert for any threat against you , since many of the 
Achaeans are planning evil . 
And may 
Zeus destroy them before 
they can strike at us . / �May it be so , old
