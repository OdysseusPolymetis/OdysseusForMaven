�So we came to the floating island of 
Aeolia , where 
Aeolus lived , son of 
Hippotas , dear to the deathless gods . a wall of unbroken bronze surrounds it , and the cliffs are sheer . in those halls his twelve children live as well , six daughters and six fine sons , and he has given his daughters to his sons in marriage . 
They are always feasting with their brave father and good mother , with endless good food set before them . All day long the house is full of savoury smells , and the courtyard echoes to the banquet�s sound , while at night they sleep by the wives they love , on well-covered well-strung beds . / 
We came , then , to their 
city with its fine palace , and 
Aeolus entertained me there for a month , questioning me on everything : 
Troy , the 
Argive fleet , and the 
Achaean return . 
And I told him the whole tale in order . 
When I asked , in turn , to depart with his help , he too denied me nothing . 
He gave me a leather bag , made from the flayed hide of a nine-year old ox , and imprisoned all the winds there . The son of 
Cronos 
had made him the winds� keeper , able to raise or calm them as he wished . 
He placed the bag in my hollow ship and tied it tight with shining silver wire , so not even the smallest breath might escape . but he first called on the 
West 
Wind to blow and set my ships and their crews on our homeward course , though it was not to benefit us , ruined by our own foolishness . / Nine days and nights we sailed , and on the tenth our own land was in sight , near enough to see men tending fires . 
Then sweet sleep came to me in my weariness , since I 
had hauled on the sheets ceaselessly , handing over to none of my crew , in order to reach home more swiftly . 
Now my men talked among themselves , speculating about the treasures of gold and silver that 
Aeolus , 
mighty son of 
Hippotas , 
had given me . as they exchanged glances they said : �How honoured and loved 
Odysseus is by the men of every land and 
city ! 
He carries home fine things from the spoils of 
Troy , while we who went the same journey return empty-handed . 
Now 
Aeolus , for love alone , gives him all these gifts . 
Come on , let�s see how much gold and silver there is in the bag . � / Among them , talking like this , wicked thoughts prevailed . 
They opened the bag and all the winds rushed out . 
Then a tempest seized us , and 
carried us out to sea away from our own land . 
Then I woke , and debated in the depths of my heart whether to hurl myself from the ship and drown , or suffer in silence among the living . I stayed and suffered : wrapping my head in my cloak , I lay down on the deck . 
So , as my men groaned , the ships were 
carried back to the 
Aeolian island by a wicked gale . � / �We went ashore and replenished our water , my men eating a meal quickly by the swift ships . 
When we 
had eaten and drunk , I set out for Aeolus� fine palace , taking with me a 
herald and one other of my men . I found the king feasting with his wife and children . 
We entered and sat down at the threshold by the doorposts . 
They were amazed , asking me : �Odysseus , how do you come to be here ? 
What cruel god opposed you ? 
We sent you off with care , heading for your home and country , as you wished . � / 
Sad at heart , I answered : �Sleep and my foolish crew brought me harm , but you , my friends , have the power to set all to rights . � 
They were silent at my speech , despite its flattering words . 
Then the father replied , saying : �Leave our island , now , lowest of living men . It would be against religion for me to set a man on his course when the blessed gods revile him . Go , for you come as one the immortals hate . � / 
With this , he dismissed me from his palace , I groaning deeply . 
Grieving at heart , we sailed away . The men�s spirits were depressed by the heavy work of rowing , since never a breeze came to help us on our way , because of their foolishness . / six days and nights we sailed , and on the seventh we reached 
Telepylus , the great 
Laestrygonian citadel of 
Lamus , where the herdsman driving in his flock at the day�s end calls to the herdsman driving his out as the day begins . 
There night and day is one , and a man who needs no sleep could earn a double wage , one for herding the cattle , one for grazing the white sheep . 
We reached a fine harbour , with a stretch of sheer cliff on both sides , and narrow access between the opposing headlands , jutting out at its mouth . 
My captains took their curving ships inside , and moored them close together in the cavernous harbour , since all around us was shining calm , with never a wave , great or small . but I , alone , moored my black ship outside , near the cliffs , making fast to a rock . 
Then I climbed the rugged headland , and stood there to look out : no cattle could be seen or buildings , only a trace of smoke rising inland . 
So I sent a party of my men to find out what sort of beings lived there . I chose two to go and a third as 
herald . � / �Once ashore , they found a well-worn track down which wagons 
carried wood to the 
city from the mountain heights . 
Near the citadel they came across a girl drawing water , the sturdy daughter of 
Laestrygonian 
Antiphates . 
She 
had come to Artacia�s flowing stream , from which the 
city drew its water . 
They approached her and asked who was the king of her people , and who the people were whom he ruled . 
She pointed at once to her father�s lofty house . / on entering his fine palace , they found his wife there , massive as a mountaintop , and they were shocked . 
She called her husband , 
mighty 
Antiphates , straight from their gathering place , and he embarked on their cruel destruction . 
He promptly seized one of my men , and prepared to eat him , while the other two sprang up and fled to the ships . 
Then 
Antiphates 
roused the 
city , and hearing his cry the huge 
Laestrygonians crowded in from all sides , a countless host of Giants not men . / 
From the cliffs they pelted us with the largest rocks a man could lift , and from all the ships there rose the groans of dying men and the splintering of timbers . 
Spearing the men like fishes , they 
carried them off to their loathsome feast . 
While they were killing those in the harbour�s depths , I drew my sharp sword and cut the cable of my dark-prowed vessel . 
Then calling to my men I ordered them to the oars , so we might escape from danger . 
With the fear of death on them they thrashed the sea with their blades , and to our joy the ship shot away from the towering cliffs , leaving the rest to founder where they were . � / �So we sailed on , with heavy hearts for the loyal friends lost , though happy to have escaped death ourselves , and came to the island of 
Aeaea , where 
Circe of the lovely tresses lived , a fateful goddess with a human voice , sister to dark-minded 
Aeetes : both children of the 
Sun that lights the world , and Perse , daughter of the 
Ocean . 
Here our ship closed the shore in silence , entering a harbour fit for vessels , guided by a god . 
When we 
had gone ashore we lay there for two days and nights consumed by weariness and grief . / but when 
Dawn of the lovely tresses gave birth to the third day I took my sharp sword and spear and climbed swiftly from the ship to a high lookout point , hoping to see signs of men , and hear their voices . I reached a rocky height with a wide view , and standing there I saw smoke rising through thick scrub and woodland , from the wide clearing where Circe�s halls lay . 
Seeing that smoke from a fire , I pondered whether to go and explore , but it seemed better to return to the ship and the shore , and allow my men a meal , then send them to investigate . / 
Then as I neared the swift ship some god took pity on me in that solitude , and sent a huge stag with great antlers right across my trail . The power of the sun 
had troubled him and sent him down from his woodland pasture to drink at the river�s edge . as he came from the water I struck him on the spine with my bronze-spear , in the centre of his back , and it pierced right through , so he fell in the dust with a groan , and his spirit passed . 
Then I planted my foot on his carcass , drew the bronze spear from the wound , and laid it on the ground while I gathered willow shoots then wove a rope , six foot long , by splicing them together end to end . Next I tied the great creature�s feet together , and 
carried him down to the black ship on my back , using my spear to lean on , since he was too large to sling over my shoulder and steady with my hand . I threw him down in front of the ship and cheered my crew with comforting words , tackling each man in turn : / �We�re not bound for the halls of 
Hades ahead of time , my Friends , despite our troubles . 
Come , while there�s still food and drink in our swift ship , let�s think about eating , not waste away with hunger . � / 
They soon responded to my words . 
They drew their cloaks from their faces to marvel at the stag�s huge size , as he lay on the barren shore . 
When they 
had sated their sight with gazing , they washed their hands and readied a fine feast . All day long till the sun went down we sat and feasted on meat in plenty , and drank sweet wine . but once the sun 
had set and darkness fell , we lay down on the sand to sleep . 
When rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , I called the men together and addressed them all : / �Listen , Friends , and 
understand our plight . 
We have no idea how far 
East or 
West we are , how far it is to where the light-giving sun rises or where he sinks below the earth . 
Though we should consider what options we have left , I suspect we have few . I climbed to a rocky lookout point and could see that the island is low-lying , ringed by the boundless waves . 
And in the centre I saw smoke rising through thick scrub and woodland . �� / �At this , their hearts sank , remembering 
Laestrygonian 
Antiphates , and the fierce violence of the man-eating 
Cyclops . 
They groaned aloud , and wept great tears . but all their lamentation did no good . / I split my armed comrades into two groups , each with its own leader . I took command of one , and the other was led by noble 
Eurylochus . 
Then we shook lots in a bronze helmet , and brave Eurylochus�s lot leapt out . off he went with twenty-two tearful men , leaving us behind with our grief . 
They found 
Circe�s house of polished stone , in a clearing in the forest glades . round it wolves and mountain lions prowled , bewitched by Circe with her magic drugs . 
Instead of rushing to attack my men , they rose on their hind legs and wagged their tails . 
Like dogs fawning round their master , back from a feast , bringing them the titbits they enjoy , the wolves and sharp-clawed lions fawned round my men , while they seeing these dread creatures were gripped by fear . 
They stood there at the gate of the goddess with lovely tresses , and they could hear Circe�s sweet voice singing inside , as she went to and fro in front of a vast divine tapestry , weaving the finely-made , lovely , shining work of the goddesses . / 
Then 
Polites , the dearest and most trusted of my friends , a man of initiative , spoke : �Friends , a woman , a goddess perhaps , is singing sweetly within , walking to and fro in front of a great tapestry , and the whole place echoes . Let�s call out to her , now . � / 
At that , they shouted , and called to her , and 
Circe came to open the shining doors , and invite them to enter : and so they innocently followed her inside . 
Eurylochus alone , suspecting it was a trap , stayed behind . 
She ushered the rest in , and seated them on stools and chairs , and mixed them a brew of yellow honey and 
Pramnian wine , with cheese and barley meal . but she mixed in wicked drugs , as well , so they might wholly forget their native land . 
When they 
had drunk the brew she gave them , she touched them with her wand , and herded them into the pigsties . 
Now they 
had the shape and bristly hide , the features and voice of pigs , but their minds were unaltered from before . 
There they wept in their pens , and 
Circe gave them acorns , beech mast , and cornel fruit to eat , such as pigs feed on as they churn the mud . / but 
Eurylochus ran back to the swift black ship , to convey the news of his friends and their sad fate . 
Much as he wished to , he could not speak a word , his heart was so full of anguish , and his eyes filled with tears , and his mind with sorrow . 
Only when we questioned him , amazed , did he manage to say what 
had happened to his friends : � / ��We went through the woods , noble 
Odysseus , as you ordered . in a clearing in the forest glades we found a fine palace built of cut stone . Someone inside , a woman or a goddess , was singing in a clear voice as she walked to and fro , in front of a huge tapestry . The men shouted and called to her , and she came to open the shining doors , and invited them to enter : and so they innocently followed her inside . but I , suspecting it was a trap , stayed behind . 
Then they all disappeared , and no one emerged again , though I sat a long time watching . � / 
At Eurylochus� words , I slung my great bronze silver-embossed sword over my shoulders , and my bow as well , and told him to take me there by the selfsame road . but he clutched at me with his hands , and clasped my knees , and spoke winged words , through his tears : �Favourite of 
Zeus , leave me here : don�t force me to return unwillingly . I know you and our comrades will never come back . let us escape quickly with those who are still here , and we may still evade the day of evil . � / I replied : �Eurylochus , by all means stay here by the black ship�s hull , eating and drinking , but I , bound by necessity , will go . � / 
With this I climbed away from the ship and the shore . but as I walked through the sacred grove , towards the great house of 
Circe , a goddess skilled in magic potions , 
Hermes of the golden 
Wand , in the likeness of a young man at that charming age when down first covers the cheeks , met me as I approached . 
He clasped me by the hand and spoke to me : / �Wretched man , where are you off to , wandering the hills of an unknown island all alone ? 
Your friends are penned in Circe�s house , pigs in close-set sties . have you come to free them ? I tell you , you won�t return , you�ll end up like the rest . but I will save you and keep you free from harm . 
You must take a powerful herb with you , and go to Circe�s house , and it will ward off the day of evil . I will tell you all Circe�s fatal wiles . 
She will mix a drink for you , blending drugs with the food , but even so she will fail to enchant you : the powerful herb I will give you will prevent it . let me tell you the rest . 
When 
Circe strikes you with her length of wand , draw your sharp sword and rush at her , as if you intend to kill her . 
She will be seized with fear . 
Then she�ll invite you to her bed , and don�t refuse the goddess� favours , if you want her to free your men , and care for you too . but make her swear a solemn oath by the blessed gods that she won�t try to harm you with her mischief , lest when you are naked she robs you of courage and manhood . � / �With this the 
Slayer of argus pulled the herb from the ground , and gave it to me , pointing out its features . It was black at the root with a milk-white flower . moly the gods call it , difficult for mortals to uproot , though the gods of course can do anything . 
Hermes headed off through the wooded isle to high 
Olympus , while I approached the house of 
Circe , thinking black thoughts as I went along . / 
There I stood , at the gate of the goddess of the lovely tresses , and I called to her and she heard my voice . 
She came out straight away to open the shining doors , and invited me to enter . I did so , with a troubled heart . once inside she brought me a beautiful silver-embossed chair , richly made , and with a stool for my feet . 
Then she mixed me a drink in a golden cup , and with evil intent added her drugs . 
When she gave it me , and I drank it down , though without feeling its enchantment , she struck at me with her wand , and cried : �Off to your sty now , and lie there with your friends . � / 
At this , I drew my sharp sword and rushed at her , as if I meant to kill her , but with a cry she slipped beneath the blade to clasp my knees , and weeping spoke to me with winged words : �
What man are you , and where are you from ? What 
city is yours ? 
And who are your parents ? I wonder that you drank my potion , and were not bewitched . No other man when once he drank , and swallowed it , has ever withstood the spell . 
Surely your mind is not one to be swayed . 
You must be 
Odysseus , that man of many resources whom the 
Slayer of argus , with the golden 
Wand , told me would come from 
Troy here , travelling homewards , in his swift dark ship . 
Come , sheathe your sword , and let us two go to my bed , so we may learn to trust one another by twining in love . � / Those were her words , and I replied : �Circe , how can you demand that I be tender to you , you who have turned my friends to animals in your house , and now detain me , drawing me to your room , to your bed , with cunning intent , to rob me of courage and manhood when I am naked . I have no desire to go to bed with you , goddess , unless you swear a solemn oath by the blessed gods not to try and harm me with your mischief . � / �When I 
had done , she quickly swore an oath not to harm me , as I required . 
And when she 
had sworn the oath I went with 
Circe to her fine bed . / 
Meanwhile her four handmaids , who serve her round the house , were busy in the hall . 
One of those children of springs , groves and sacred rivers that run to the sea threw linen covers over the chairs and spread fine purple fabrics on top . Another drew silver tables up to the chairs , and laid out golden dishes , while a third mixed sweet honeyed wine in a silver bowl , and served it in golden cups . The fourth fetched water and lit a roaring fire beneath a huge cauldron . 
When the water boiled in the shining bronze , she sat me in a bath , and bathed me with water from the great cauldron mixed with cold to suit , pouring it over my head and shoulders till she drew the deep weariness from my limbs . / 
When she 
had bathed me and rubbed me with oil , and dressed me in a fine tunic and cloak , she led me into the hall , and seated me on a beautiful silver-embossed chair , richly made , and with a stool for my feet . 
Then a maid brought water to wash my hands in a lovely golden jug , and poured it out over a silver basin so I could rinse them , and drew up a shining table beside me . The faithful housekeeper brought bread , and set it before me with heaps of delicacies , giving freely of her stores . 
Then she begged me to eat , though I 
had no heart for eating . 
My mind was full of other thoughts and my spirit was full of forebodings . / 
When 
Circe saw me sitting there , not stretching out my hands to the food , but weighed down with sorrow , she approached and spoke with winged words : �Odysseus , why do you sit as if you were dumb , eating your heart out , not touching the food or drink ? are you suspicious of some new ruse ? have no fear , I have sworn you a solemn oath already not to do you harm . � / To this I answered : �Circe , what decent man could bring himself to eat and drink before he 
had freed his men , and seen them face to face ? if you wish me in truth to eat and drink as you ask , then set them free and let me see my loyal friends with my own eyes . � / 
At this , 
Circe , taking her wand , went out of the hall and opened the gates of the sty , and drove out what seemed to be full-grown pigs . 
They stood there and she went among them smearing each one with a fresh potion . 
Then the bristles , that Circe�s previous hateful spell 
had made them sprout , fell from them , and they became men again , younger and handsomer and taller by far than they were before . 
They knew me now , and each man clasped my hands , and all were wracked with weeping , till the walls echoed , mournfully , and even the goddess was moved to pity . ��Then the lovely goddess drew near , and said : �Odysseus , of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , Laertes� son , go now to your swift ship and the shore . drag your ship on land : store your tackle and goods in the caves . 
Then return with your loyal friends . � / To this my proud heart consented , and I went down to the swift ship and the shore , and there by the speedy vessel I found my faithful comrades , lamenting and shedding tears . 
Like calves in a farmyard that frisk around the herd of cows that return from grazing , free from their pens and gambolling together , lowing constantly round their mothers , so those men , at the sight of me , crowded round weeping , and in their hearts they felt as though they were home again in rugged Ithaca , in the town where they were born and bred . Still grieving , they spoke with winged words : �We are as happy , favourite of 
Zeus , as though we were back in Ithaca , but tell us the fate of the rest of our friends . � / I replied with calming words : �First drag the ship on land , and store our tackle and goods in the caves , then hurry , follow me , and you�ll see your friends eating and drinking in Circe�s halls , where there�s enough food and drink to last for ever . � 
They quickly responded to my words . 
Only 
Eurylochus of all my friends hung back . 
And he spoke to them with winged words : �Wretched fools , where are you off to ? are you so in love with trouble you�ll visit Circe�s house , she who will change you all to pigs , or wolves , or lions to guard her great hall under duress ? Remember how 
Cyclops too behaved , when our friends entered his cave with reckless 
Odysseus , this man through whose foolishness they died . � / Those were his words , and I felt like drawing the long sword strapped to my sturdy thigh and striking his head to the ground , though he was a kinsman of mine by marriage , but my friends each checked me with soothing words : �Scion of 
Zeus , let�s leave him behind , if you will , to stay and guard the ship , while you lead us to Circe�s sacred house . � / 
So we left the ship and shore , but 
Eurylochus did not stay behind by the hollow hull , he came with us , fearing my stern rebuke . / �Meanwhile my friends 
had been bathed in Circe�s house , through her kind ministrations , and 
had been rubbed with rich oil , and dressed in tunics and fleece-lined cloaks , and we found them feasting happily in the hall . 
When my two companies saw each other face to face , they wept and moaned in recognition , and the whole house echoed . 
Then the lovely goddess approached me , saying : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , calm this outpouring of grief . I know myself all you have suffered on the teeming waves , and all the wrongs that enemies have done to you on land . but , come now , eat my food and drink my wine , till you each regain the spirit you 
had when you left your homes on rugged Ithaca . 
You are spiritless , and drained by endless thought of your harsh journey , and your hearts are always joyless , for in truth you have suffered . � / Our proud hearts yielded to her words . 
And so we stayed there , day after day , eating food in plenty , and drinking the sweet wine . but when a whole year 
had gone by , as the months and seasons passed , and the longer days 
had returned my loyal friends took me aside and said : �Man who is kin to the gods , remember your native country , now , if it is still your fate to escape , and reach your lofty house , and your own land . � / 
My proud heart yielded to their words . a further long day , till sunset , we feasted on meat in plenty and drank sweet wine . 
When the sun sank and darkness fell , they settled down to sleep in the shadowy hall , but I went to Circe�s lovely bed , and clasped her knees , and the goddess listened as I spoke winged words : �Circe , keep the promise you gave and send me on my way , since my spirit is eager for home , and so too are my friends� , who weary me with their grief whenever you happen to be absent . � / To this the lovely goddess replied swiftly : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , don�t stay here a moment longer against your will , but before you head for home you must make another journey . 
You must seek the house of 
Hades and dread 
Persephone , and consult the ghost of the blind 
Theban seer , 
Teiresias . 
His mind is still unimpaired , for even in death 
Persephone grants him mental powers , so that he alone has wisdom , while the others flit like shadows . � / 
At her words my spirits fell , sitting there on the bed I wept , and I no longer wished to live , and see the sunlight . but when I was wearied with weeping and wringing my hands , I answered her , saying : �Circe , who will guide us on the way ? No man yet has ever sailed to 
Hades in a black ship . �� / �The lovely goddess replied swiftly : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , don�t think of finding a pilot to guide your vessel , but raise your mast and spread your white sail , and take your seat aboard , and the 
North Wind�s breath will send her on her way . 
When you have crossed the 
Ocean stream , beach your ship by the deep swirling waters on a level shore , where tall poplars , and willows that shed seed , fill the 
Groves of 
Persephone . 
Then go to the moist house of 
Hades . 
There is a rock where two roaring rivers join the 
Acheron , 
Cocytus , which is a tributary of the 
Styx , and 
Pyriphlegethon . 
Draw near then , as I bid you , hero , and dig a trench two feet square , then pour a libation all around to the dead , first of milk and honey , then of sweet wine , thirdly of water , sprinkled with white barley meal . 
Then pray devoutly to the powerless ghosts of the departed , swearing that when you reach Ithaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer in your palace , the best of the herd , and will heap the altar with rich spoils , and offer a ram , apart , to 
Teiresias , the finest jet-black ram in the flock . / 
And when you have petitioned the glorious host of the dead , with prayers , sacrifice a ram and a black ewe , holding their heads towards Erebus , while you look behind towards the running streams . 
Then the hosts of the dead will appear . 
Call then to your comrades , and tell them to flay and burn the sheep killed by the pitiless bronze , with prayers to the divinities , to 
mighty 
Hades and dread 
Persephone . 
You yourself must draw your sharp sword and sit there , preventing the powerless ghosts from drawing near to the blood , till you have questioned 
Teiresias . 
Soon the seer will come , you leader of men , and give you your course , and the distances , so you can return home over the teeming waters . � / 
Circe finished speaking , and with that came golden-throned 
Dawn . 
Then the 
Nymph dressed me in a tunic and cloak , and clothed herself in a beautiful long white closely-woven robe , and clasped a fine belt of gold around her waist , and set a veil on her head . 
Then I walked through the halls , rousing my men with cheerful words , speaking to each in turn : �My lady 
Circe has explained what I need to know : don�t lie there culling the flower of sweet sleep : let us be on our way . � / Those were my words , and their proud hearts yielded . but even now I could not get my men away unscathed . The youngest of all was 
Elpenor , not one of the cleverest or bravest in battle . 
Heavy with wine he 
had climbed to the roof of Circe�s sacred house , seeking the cool night air , and 
had slept apart from his friends . 
Hearing the stir and noise of their departure , he leapt up suddenly , and forgetting the way down by the long ladder , he fell headlong from the roof . 
His neck was shattered where it joins the spine : his ghost descended , to the house of 
Hades . / 
My crew were already on their way , as I addressed them : �No doubt you think you are heading home , but 
Circe has set us on a different course , to the house of 
Hades and dread 
Persephone where I must consult the ghost of 
Theban 
Teiresias . � 
At this their spirits fell , and they sat right down where they were and wept , and tore at their hair . but their lamentations served no purpose . / 
While we made our way to our swift vessel and the shore , grieving and shedding tears , 
Circe went on ahead of us , and tethered a ram and a black ewe by the black ship . 
She 
had easily slipped by us : who can observe a goddess passing to and fro , if she wishes otherwise ? � / �So we came to the floating island of 
Aeolia , where 
Aeolus lived , son of 
Hippotas , dear to the deathless gods . a wall of unbroken bronze surrounds it , and the cliffs are sheer . in those halls his twelve children live as well , six daughters and six fine sons , and he has given his daughters to his sons in marriage . 
They are always feasting with their brave father and good mother , with endless good food set before them . All day long the house is full of savoury smells , and the courtyard echoes to the banquet�s sound , while at night they sleep by the wives they love , on well-covered well-strung beds . / 
We came , then , to their 
city with its fine palace , and 
Aeolus entertained me there for a month , questioning me on everything : 
Troy , the 
Argive fleet , and the 
Achaean return . 
And I told him the whole tale in order . 
When I asked , in turn , to depart with his help , he too denied me nothing . 
He gave me a leather bag , made from the flayed hide of a nine-year old ox , and imprisoned all the winds there . The son of 
Cronos 
had made him the winds� keeper , able to raise or calm them as he wished . 
He placed the bag in my hollow ship and tied it tight with shining silver wire , so not even the smallest breath might escape . but he first called on the 
West 
Wind to blow and set my ships and their crews on our homeward course , though it was not to benefit us , ruined by our own foolishness . / Nine days and nights we sailed , and on the tenth our own land was in sight , near enough to see men tending fires . 
Then sweet sleep came to me in my weariness , since I 
had hauled on the sheets ceaselessly , handing over to none of my crew , in order to reach home more swiftly . 
Now my men talked among themselves , speculating about the treasures of gold and silver that 
Aeolus , 
mighty son of 
Hippotas , 
had given me . as they exchanged glances they said : �How honoured and loved 
Odysseus is by the men of every land and 
city ! 
He carries home fine things from the spoils of 
Troy , while we who went the same journey return empty-handed . 
Now 
Aeolus , for love alone , gives him all these gifts . 
Come on , let�s see how much gold and silver there is in the bag . � / Among them , talking like this , wicked thoughts prevailed . 
They opened the bag and all the winds rushed out . 
Then a tempest seized us , and 
carried us out to sea away from our own land . 
Then I woke , and debated in the depths of my heart whether to hurl myself from the ship and drown , or suffer in silence among the living . I stayed and suffered : wrapping my head in my cloak , I lay down on the deck . 
So , as my men groaned , the ships were 
carried back to the 
Aeolian island by a wicked gale . � / �We went ashore and replenished our water , my men eating a meal quickly by the swift ships . 
When we 
had eaten and drunk , I set out for Aeolus� fine palace , taking with me a 
herald and one other of my men . I found the king feasting with his wife and children . 
We entered and sat down at the threshold by the doorposts . 
They were amazed , asking me : �Odysseus , how do you come to be here ? 
What cruel god opposed you ? 
We sent you off with care , heading for your home and country , as you wished . � / 
Sad at heart , I answered : �Sleep and my foolish crew brought me harm , but you , my friends , have the power to set all to rights . � 
They were silent at my speech , despite its flattering words . 
Then the father replied , saying : �Leave our island , now , lowest of living men . It would be against religion for me to set a man on his course when the blessed gods revile him . Go , for you come as one the immortals hate . � / 
With this , he dismissed me from his palace , I groaning deeply . 
Grieving at heart , we sailed away . The men�s spirits were depressed by the heavy work of rowing , since never a breeze came to help us on our way , because of their foolishness . / six days and nights we sailed , and on the seventh we reached 
Telepylus , the great 
Laestrygonian citadel of 
Lamus , where the herdsman driving in his flock at the day�s end calls to the herdsman driving his out as the day begins . 
There night and day is one , and a man who needs no sleep could earn a double wage , one for herding the cattle , one for grazing the white sheep . 
We reached a fine harbour , with a stretch of sheer cliff on both sides , and narrow access between the opposing headlands , jutting out at its mouth . 
My captains took their curving ships inside , and moored them close together in the cavernous harbour , since all around us was shining calm , with never a wave , great or small . but I , alone , moored my black ship outside , near the cliffs , making fast to a rock . 
Then I climbed the rugged headland , and stood there to look out : no cattle could be seen or buildings , only a trace of smoke rising inland . 
So I sent a party of my men to find out what sort of beings lived there . I chose two to go and a third as 
herald . � / �Once ashore , they found a well-worn track down which wagons 
carried wood to the 
city from the mountain heights . 
Near the citadel they came across a girl drawing water , the sturdy daughter of 
Laestrygonian 
Antiphates . 
She 
had come to Artacia�s flowing stream , from which the 
city drew its water . 
They approached her and asked who was the king of her people , and who the people were whom he ruled . 
She pointed at once to her father�s lofty house . / on entering his fine palace , they found his wife there , massive as a mountaintop , and they were shocked . 
She called her husband , 
mighty 
Antiphates , straight from their gathering place , and he embarked on their cruel destruction . 
He promptly seized one of my men , and prepared to eat him , while the other two sprang up and fled to the ships . 
Then 
Antiphates 
roused the 
city , and hearing his cry the huge 
Laestrygonians crowded in from all sides , a countless host of Giants not men . / 
From the cliffs they pelted us with the largest rocks a man could lift , and from all the ships there rose the groans of dying men and the splintering of timbers . 
Spearing the men like fishes , they 
carried them off to their loathsome feast . 
While they were killing those in the harbour�s depths , I drew my sharp sword and cut the cable of my dark-prowed vessel . 
Then calling to my men I ordered them to the oars , so we might escape from danger . 
With the fear of death on them they thrashed the sea with their blades , and to our joy the ship shot away from the towering cliffs , leaving the rest to founder where they were . � / �So we sailed on , with heavy hearts for the loyal friends lost , though happy to have escaped death ourselves , and came to the island of 
Aeaea , where 
Circe of the lovely tresses lived , a fateful goddess with a human voice , sister to dark-minded 
Aeetes : both children of the 
Sun that lights the world , and Perse , daughter of the 
Ocean . 
Here our ship closed the shore in silence , entering a harbour fit for vessels , guided by a god . 
When we 
had gone ashore we lay there for two days and nights consumed by weariness and grief . / but when 
Dawn of the lovely tresses gave birth to the third day I took my sharp sword and spear and climbed swiftly from the ship to a high lookout point , hoping to see signs of men , and hear their voices . I reached a rocky height with a wide view , and standing there I saw smoke rising through thick scrub and woodland , from the wide clearing where Circe�s halls lay . 
Seeing that smoke from a fire , I pondered whether to go and explore , but it seemed better to return to the ship and the shore , and allow my men a meal , then send them to investigate . / 
Then as I neared the swift ship some god took pity on me in that solitude , and sent a huge stag with great antlers right across my trail . The power of the sun 
had troubled him and sent him down from his woodland pasture to drink at the river�s edge . as he came from the water I struck him on the spine with my bronze-spear , in the centre of his back , and it pierced right through , so he fell in the dust with a groan , and his spirit passed . 
Then I planted my foot on his carcass , drew the bronze spear from the wound , and laid it on the ground while I gathered willow shoots then wove a rope , six foot long , by splicing them together end to end . Next I tied the great creature�s feet together , and 
carried him down to the black ship on my back , using my spear to lean on , since he was too large to sling over my shoulder and steady with my hand . I threw him down in front of the ship and cheered my crew with comforting words , tackling each man in turn : / �We�re not bound for the halls of 
Hades ahead of time , my Friends , despite our troubles . 
Come , while there�s still food and drink in our swift ship , let�s think about eating , not waste away with hunger . � / 
They soon responded to my words . 
They drew their cloaks from their faces to marvel at the stag�s huge size , as he lay on the barren shore . 
When they 
had sated their sight with gazing , they washed their hands and readied a fine feast . All day long till the sun went down we sat and feasted on meat in plenty , and drank sweet wine . but once the sun 
had set and darkness fell , we lay down on the sand to sleep . 
When rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , I called the men together and addressed them all : / �Listen , Friends , and 
understand our plight . 
We have no idea how far 
East or 
West we are , how far it is to where the light-giving sun rises or where he sinks below the earth . 
Though we should consider what options we have left , I suspect we have few . I climbed to a rocky lookout point and could see that the island is low-lying , ringed by the boundless waves . 
And in the centre I saw smoke rising through thick scrub and woodland . �� / �At this , their hearts sank , remembering 
Laestrygonian 
Antiphates , and the fierce violence of the man-eating 
Cyclops . 
They groaned aloud , and wept great tears . but all their lamentation did no good . / I split my armed comrades into two groups , each with its own leader . I took command of one , and the other was led by noble 
Eurylochus . 
Then we shook lots in a bronze helmet , and brave Eurylochus�s lot leapt out . off he went with twenty-two tearful men , leaving us behind with our grief . 
They found 
Circe�s house of polished stone , in a clearing in the forest glades . round it wolves and mountain lions prowled , bewitched by Circe with her magic drugs . 
Instead of rushing to attack my men , they rose on their hind legs and wagged their tails . 
Like dogs fawning round their master , back from a feast , bringing them the titbits they enjoy , the wolves and sharp-clawed lions fawned round my men , while they seeing these dread creatures were gripped by fear . 
They stood there at the gate of the goddess with lovely tresses , and they could hear Circe�s sweet voice singing inside , as she went to and fro in front of a vast divine tapestry , weaving the finely-made , lovely , shining work of the goddesses . / 
Then 
Polites , the dearest and most trusted of my friends , a man of initiative , spoke : �Friends , a woman , a goddess perhaps , is singing sweetly within , walking to and fro in front of a great tapestry , and the whole place echoes . Let�s call out to her , now . � / 
At that , they shouted , and called to her , and 
Circe came to open the shining doors , and invite them to enter : and so they innocently followed her inside . 
Eurylochus alone , suspecting it was a trap , stayed behind . 
She ushered the rest in , and seated them on stools and chairs , and mixed them a brew of yellow honey and 
Pramnian wine , with cheese and barley meal . but she mixed in wicked drugs , as well , so they might wholly forget their native land . 
When they 
had drunk the brew she gave them , she touched them with her wand , and herded them into the pigsties . 
Now they 
had the shape and bristly hide , the features and voice of pigs , but their minds were unaltered from before . 
There they wept in their pens , and 
Circe gave them acorns , beech mast , and cornel fruit to eat , such as pigs feed on as they churn the mud . / but 
Eurylochus ran back to the swift black ship , to convey the news of his friends and their sad fate . 
Much as he wished to , he could not speak a word , his heart was so full of anguish , and his eyes filled with tears , and his mind with sorrow . 
Only when we questioned him , amazed , did he manage to say what 
had happened to his friends : � / ��We went through the woods , noble 
Odysseus , as you ordered . in a clearing in the forest glades we found a fine palace built of cut stone . Someone inside , a woman or a goddess , was singing in a clear voice as she walked to and fro , in front of a huge tapestry . The men shouted and called to her , and she came to open the shining doors , and invited them to enter : and so they innocently followed her inside . but I , suspecting it was a trap , stayed behind . 
Then they all disappeared , and no one emerged again , though I sat a long time watching . � / 
At Eurylochus� words , I slung my great bronze silver-embossed sword over my shoulders , and my bow as well , and told him to take me there by the selfsame road . but he clutched at me with his hands , and clasped my knees , and spoke winged words , through his tears : �Favourite of 
Zeus , leave me here : don�t force me to return unwillingly . I know you and our comrades will never come back . let us escape quickly with those who are still here , and we may still evade the day of evil . � / I replied : �Eurylochus , by all means stay here by the black ship�s hull , eating and drinking , but I , bound by necessity , will go . � / 
With this I climbed away from the ship and the shore . but as I walked through the sacred grove , towards the great house of 
Circe , a goddess skilled in magic potions , 
Hermes of the golden 
Wand , in the likeness of a young man at that charming age when down first covers the cheeks , met me as I approached . 
He clasped me by the hand and spoke to me : / �Wretched man , where are you off to , wandering the hills of an unknown island all alone ? 
Your friends are penned in Circe�s house , pigs in close-set sties . have you come to free them ? I tell you , you won�t return , you�ll end up like the rest . but I will save you and keep you free from harm . 
You must take a powerful herb with you , and go to Circe�s house , and it will ward off the day of evil . I will tell you all Circe�s fatal wiles . 
She will mix a drink for you , blending drugs with the food , but even so she will fail to enchant you : the powerful herb I will give you will prevent it . let me tell you the rest . 
When 
Circe strikes you with her length of wand , draw your sharp sword and rush at her , as if you intend to kill her . 
She will be seized with fear . 
Then she�ll invite you to her bed , and don�t refuse the goddess� favours , if you want her to free your men , and care for you too . but make her swear a solemn oath by the blessed gods that she won�t try to harm you with her mischief , lest when you are naked she robs you of courage and manhood . � / �With this the 
Slayer of argus pulled the herb from the ground , and gave it to me , pointing out its features . It was black at the root with a milk-white flower . moly the gods call it , difficult for mortals to uproot , though the gods of course can do anything . 
Hermes headed off through the wooded isle to high 
Olympus , while I approached the house of 
Circe , thinking black thoughts as I went along . / 
There I stood , at the gate of the goddess of the lovely tresses , and I called to her and she heard my voice . 
She came out straight away to open the shining doors , and invited me to enter . I did so , with a troubled heart . once inside she brought me a beautiful silver-embossed chair , richly made , and with a stool for my feet . 
Then she mixed me a drink in a golden cup , and with evil intent added her drugs . 
When she gave it me , and I drank it down , though without feeling its enchantment , she struck at me with her wand , and cried : �Off to your sty now , and lie there with your friends . � / 
At this , I drew my sharp sword and rushed at her , as if I meant to kill her , but with a cry she slipped beneath the blade to clasp my knees , and weeping spoke to me with winged words : �
What man are you , and where are you from ? What 
city is yours ? 
And who are your parents ? I wonder that you drank my potion , and were not bewitched . No other man when once he drank , and swallowed it , has ever withstood the spell . 
Surely your mind is not one to be swayed . 
You must be 
Odysseus , that man of many resources whom the 
Slayer of argus , with the golden 
Wand , told me would come from 
Troy here , travelling homewards , in his swift dark ship . 
Come , sheathe your sword , and let us two go to my bed , so we may learn to trust one another by twining in love . � / Those were her words , and I replied : �Circe , how can you demand that I be tender to you , you who have turned my friends to animals in your house , and now detain me , drawing me to your room , to your bed , with cunning intent , to rob me of courage and manhood when I am naked . I have no desire to go to bed with you , goddess , unless you swear a solemn oath by the blessed gods not to try and harm me with your mischief . � / �When I 
had done , she quickly swore an oath not to harm me , as I required . 
And when she 
had sworn the oath I went with 
Circe to her fine bed . / 
Meanwhile her four handmaids , who serve her round the house , were busy in the hall . 
One of those children of springs , groves and sacred rivers that run to the sea threw linen covers over the chairs and spread fine purple fabrics on top . Another drew silver tables up to the chairs , and laid out golden dishes , while a third mixed sweet honeyed wine in a silver bowl , and served it in golden cups . The fourth fetched water and lit a roaring fire beneath a huge cauldron . 
When the water boiled in the shining bronze , she sat me in a bath , and bathed me with water from the great cauldron mixed with cold to suit , pouring it over my head and shoulders till she drew the deep weariness from my limbs . / 
When she 
had bathed me and rubbed me with oil , and dressed me in a fine tunic and cloak , she led me into the hall , and seated me on a beautiful silver-embossed chair , richly made , and with a stool for my feet . 
Then a maid brought water to wash my hands in a lovely golden jug , and poured it out over a silver basin so I could rinse them , and drew up a shining table beside me . The faithful housekeeper brought bread , and set it before me with heaps of delicacies , giving freely of her stores . 
Then she begged me to eat , though I 
had no heart for eating . 
My mind was full of other thoughts and my spirit was full of forebodings . / 
When 
Circe saw me sitting there , not stretching out my hands to the food , but weighed down with sorrow , she approached and spoke with winged words : �Odysseus , why do you sit as if you were dumb , eating your heart out , not touching the food or drink ? are you suspicious of some new ruse ? have no fear , I have sworn you a solemn oath already not to do you harm . � / To this I answered : �Circe , what decent man could bring himself to eat and drink before he 
had freed his men , and seen them face to face ? if you wish me in truth to eat and drink as you ask , then set them free and let me see my loyal friends with my own eyes . � / 
At this , 
Circe , taking her wand , went out of the hall and opened the gates of the sty , and drove out what seemed to be full-grown pigs . 
They stood there and she went among them smearing each one with a fresh potion . 
Then the bristles , that Circe�s previous hateful spell 
had made them sprout , fell from them , and they became men again , younger and handsomer and taller by far than they were before . 
They knew me now , and each man clasped my hands , and all were wracked with weeping , till the walls echoed , mournfully , and even the goddess was moved to pity . ��Then the lovely goddess drew near , and said : �Odysseus , of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , Laertes� son , go now to your swift ship and the shore . drag your ship on land : store your tackle and goods in the caves . 
Then return with your loyal friends . � / To this my proud heart consented , and I went down to the swift ship and the shore , and there by the speedy vessel I found my faithful comrades , lamenting and shedding tears . 
Like calves in a farmyard that frisk around the herd of cows that return from grazing , free from their pens and gambolling together , lowing constantly round their mothers , so those men , at the sight of me , crowded round weeping , and in their hearts they felt as though they were home again in rugged Ithaca , in the town where they were born and bred . Still grieving , they spoke with winged words : �We are as happy , favourite of 
Zeus , as though we were back in Ithaca , but tell us the fate of the rest of our friends . � / I replied with calming words : �First drag the ship on land , and store our tackle and goods in the caves , then hurry , follow me , and you�ll see your friends eating and drinking in Circe�s halls , where there�s enough food and drink to last for ever . � 
They quickly responded to my words . 
Only 
Eurylochus of all my friends hung back . 
And he spoke to them with winged words : �Wretched fools , where are you off to ? are you so in love with trouble you�ll visit Circe�s house , she who will change you all to pigs , or wolves , or lions to guard her great hall under duress ? Remember how 
Cyclops too behaved , when our friends entered his cave with reckless 
Odysseus , this man through whose foolishness they died . � / Those were his words , and I felt like drawing the long sword strapped to my sturdy thigh and striking his head to the ground , though he was a kinsman of mine by marriage , but my friends each checked me with soothing words : �Scion of 
Zeus , let�s leave him behind , if you will , to stay and guard the ship , while you lead us to Circe�s sacred house . � / 
So we left the ship and shore , but 
Eurylochus did not stay behind by the hollow hull , he came with us , fearing my stern rebuke . / �Meanwhile my friends 
had been bathed in Circe�s house , through her kind ministrations , and 
had been rubbed with rich oil , and dressed in tunics and fleece-lined cloaks , and we found them feasting happily in the hall . 
When my two companies saw each other face to face , they wept and moaned in recognition , and the whole house echoed . 
Then the lovely goddess approached me , saying : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , calm this outpouring of grief . I know myself all you have suffered on the teeming waves , and all the wrongs that enemies have done to you on land . but , come now , eat my food and drink my wine , till you each regain the spirit you 
had when you left your homes on rugged Ithaca . 
You are spiritless , and drained by endless thought of your harsh journey , and your hearts are always joyless , for in truth you have suffered . � / Our proud hearts yielded to her words . 
And so we stayed there , day after day , eating food in plenty , and drinking the sweet wine . but when a whole year 
had gone by , as the months and seasons passed , and the longer days 
had returned my loyal friends took me aside and said : �Man who is kin to the gods , remember your native country , now , if it is still your fate to escape , and reach your lofty house , and your own land . � / 
My proud heart yielded to their words . a further long day , till sunset , we feasted on meat in plenty and drank sweet wine . 
When the sun sank and darkness fell , they settled down to sleep in the shadowy hall , but I went to Circe�s lovely bed , and clasped her knees , and the goddess listened as I spoke winged words : �Circe , keep the promise you gave and send me on my way , since my spirit is eager for home , and so too are my friends� , who weary me with their grief whenever you happen to be absent . � / To this the lovely goddess replied swiftly : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , don�t stay here a moment longer against your will , but before you head for home you must make another journey . 
You must seek the house of 
Hades and dread 
Persephone , and consult the ghost of the blind 
Theban seer , 
Teiresias . 
His mind is still unimpaired , for even in death 
Persephone grants him mental powers , so that he alone has wisdom , while the others flit like shadows . � / 
At her words my spirits fell , sitting there on the bed I wept , and I no longer wished to live , and see the sunlight . but when I was wearied with weeping and wringing my hands , I answered her , saying : �Circe , who will guide us on the way ? No man yet has ever sailed to 
Hades in a black ship . �� / �The lovely goddess replied swiftly : �Odysseus , man of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , don�t think of finding a pilot to guide your vessel , but raise your mast and spread your white sail , and take your seat aboard , and the 
North Wind�s breath will send her on her way . 
When you have crossed the 
Ocean stream , beach your ship by the deep swirling waters on a level shore , where tall poplars , and willows that shed seed , fill the 
Groves of 
Persephone . 
Then go to the moist house of 
Hades . 
There is a rock where two roaring rivers join the 
Acheron , 
Cocytus , which is a tributary of the 
Styx , and 
Pyriphlegethon . 
Draw near then , as I bid you , hero , and dig a trench two feet square , then pour a libation all around to the dead , first of milk and honey , then of sweet wine , thirdly of water , sprinkled with white barley meal . 
Then pray devoutly to the powerless ghosts of the departed , swearing that when you reach Ithaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer in your palace , the best of the herd , and will heap the altar with rich spoils , and offer a ram , apart , to 
Teiresias , the finest jet-black ram in the flock . / 
And when you have petitioned the glorious host of the dead , with prayers , sacrifice a ram and a black ewe , holding their heads towards Erebus , while you look behind towards the running streams . 
Then the hosts of the dead will appear . 
Call then to your comrades , and tell them to flay and burn the sheep killed by the pitiless bronze , with prayers to the divinities , to 
mighty 
Hades and dread 
Persephone . 
You yourself must draw your sharp sword and sit there , preventing the powerless ghosts from drawing near to the blood , till you have questioned 
Teiresias . 
Soon the seer will come , you leader of men , and give you your course , and the distances , so you can return home over the teeming waters . � / 
Circe finished speaking , and with that came golden-throned 
Dawn . 
Then the 
Nymph dressed me in a tunic and cloak , and clothed herself in a beautiful long white closely-woven robe , and clasped a fine belt of gold around her waist , and set a veil on her head . 
Then I walked through the halls , rousing my men with cheerful words , speaking to each in turn : �My lady 
Circe has explained what I need to know : don�t lie there culling the flower of sweet sleep : let us be on our way . � / Those were my words , and their proud hearts yielded . but even now I could not get my men away unscathed . The youngest of all was 
Elpenor , not one of the cleverest or bravest in battle . 
Heavy with wine he 
had climbed to the roof of Circe�s sacred house , seeking the cool night air , and 
had slept apart from his friends . 
Hearing the stir and noise of their departure , he leapt up suddenly , and forgetting the way down by the long ladder , he fell headlong from the roof . 
His neck was shattered where it joins the spine : his ghost descended , to the house of 
Hades . / 
My crew were already on their way , as I addressed them : �No doubt you think you are heading home , but 
Circe has set us on a different course , to the house of 
Hades and dread 
Persephone where I must consult the ghost of 
Theban 
Teiresias . � 
At this their spirits fell , and they sat right down where they were and wept , and tore at their hair . but their lamentations served no purpose . / 
While we made our way to our swift vessel and the shore , grieving and shedding tears , 
Circe went on ahead of us , and tethered a ram and a black ewe by the black ship . 
She 
had easily slipped by us : who can observe a goddess passing to and fro , if she wishes otherwise ? � /
