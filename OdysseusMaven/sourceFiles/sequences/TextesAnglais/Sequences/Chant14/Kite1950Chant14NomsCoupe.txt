
Odysseus followed a rough track from the harbour , leading through the woods and over the hills , to the place where 
Athene had said he would find the faithful swineherd , the most loyal of all the servants 
Odysseus had acquired . 
He found him indeed , sitting in the yard in front of his hut which was built high up , on a site with a wide view , in a broad yard in the centre of a clearing . 
The swineherd had constructed it himself to hold his absent master�s swine , without his mistress� or old Laertes� knowledge . 
He had laid huge stones and topped the walls with a hedge of thorn . Beyond them he had set large close-set stakes along each side , oak stakes split to the black heart of the tree , then he had built twelve sties close together inside the yard to hold the pigs , and there were fifty breeding sows penned , wallowing there , in each . 
The boars slept outside , and there were far fewer of these since the noble 
Suitors had thinned out their numbers with their feasting , the swineherd sending them the pick of the fatted hogs . 
There were three hundred and sixty , guarded by four hounds fierce as wolves , reared by the master swineherd . / 
He himself was trimming a piece of well-tanned ox-hide , and shaping a pair of sandals for his feet while three of his men had gone out in different directions driving the swine and a fourth delivered a boar to the arrogant 
Suitors so 
they might slaughter it and enjoy the flesh . / Suddenly the dogs bayed at the sight of 
Odysseus , and rushed at him barking loudly , but he had the wit to sit down and drop his staff . 
Even then he might have been badly mauled in his own farmyard if the swineherd had not followed them swiftly , the leather falling from his hand , and hurried to the gateway , calling out to his dogs and scattering them with a shower of stones . 
Then he addressed his disguised master : �Old man , these dogs could have torn your flesh in a moment , and you would have blamed me ! as if the gods had not given me pain and grief enough . Here I am , fattening swine for other men to eat , while the godlike master I mourn for may be wandering in hunger through foreign cities and lands : that is if he�s still alive under the sun . but come to the hut with me , old man , and when you have quenched your hunger and thirst you can tell me where you come from , and all the troubles you�ve suffered . � / 
With this the faithful swineherd led the way to the hut , and ushered 
Odysseus in , then sat him down after making a pile of thick brushwood and spreading the large and shaggy skin of a wild goat on top , that served him for a bed . 
Odysseus was glad of his reception , and thanked him , saying : �May 
Zeus and the other gods give you your heart�s desire , sir , since you welcome me so warmly . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you it was who answered 
Odysseus , saying : �Stranger , it would be wrong for me to turn a guest away , even one in a worse state than you , since every beggar and stranger is from 
Zeus , and a gift , though small , from such folk as us is welcome . 
Small it must be , since that is the servants� lot , always living in fear of the masters who lord it over them , I mean young masters like ours . 
The gods have thwarted my old master�s homecoming . 
He would have cared for me with kindness , and given me things of my own , a hut and a piece of land , and a wife worthy of having been courted by many men , things a kind master grants a servant who has laboured on his behalf and whose efforts the gods favour , just as 
they further my efforts here . 
My master would have rewarded me well , indeed , had he grown old here in 
Ithaca . but he has perished , as I wish 
Helen and all her race had utterly perished , since she was the death of many a fine warrior . 
He went to ilium , famed for its horses , with all the other warriors to fight those 
Trojans , on Agamemnon�s voyage of vengeance . � / 
Saying this , he fastened his tunic with a belt , and went off to the sties where the pigs were penned . Picking two , he dragged them in , slaughtered and singed them both , then jointed and spitted them . 
When all was roasted , he served it to 
Odysseus piping hot on the skewers , sprinkling the meat with white barley meal . 
Then he mixed honey-sweet wine in an ivy-wood bowl , and sat down himself opposite 
Odysseus , saying 
invitingly : �Eat , the food , 
Stranger , that a servant can provide , sucking pig , since the pitiless 
Suitors , careless of the gods� anger , take my fatted hogs . 
Yet the blessed gods do not approve of such wanton acts : 
they honour justice and decency . 
Even men who set foot on hostile soil , owing their enemies nothing , whom 
Zeus allows to gather spoils , to fill their ships and head for home , even in their hearts the fear of divine anger stirs . but these men here must have heard the voice of some god announcing my master�s sad death , seeing 
they neither pay genuine court , nor return to their homes , but waste our possessions arrogantly , as 
they wish , sparing nothing . 
They slaughter the beasts every night and day that 
Zeus sends , and not just one or two , and 
they draw what wine 
they need and more . / 
My master was truly rich : no warrior on 
Ithaca or the dark-soiled mainland could compete , not twenty put together . I�ll describe it all : twelve cattle herds and as many flocks of sheep and droves of swine , there on the mainland , and as many roving herds of goats , all tended by locals or by foreign herdsmen . 
And on the shores of 
Ithaca here , eleven herds of goats graze , guarded by faithful men . 
And each day every man has to send the fattest of his goats along to the 
Suitors , while I the swineherd pick out the best of the boars for them . � / 
While he spoke , a grateful and ravenous 
Odysseus ate the meat and drank the wine , planning trouble for the 
Suitors . 
When he had sated his hunger and was done with eating , the swineherd filled his own drinking bowl again and offered it brimming with wine , and 
Odysseus took it gladly , and addressed him with winged words : �Who was this rich and powerful man , 
Friend , who bought you with his wealth ? 
You say he died winning vengeance for 
Agamemnon : name him , perhaps I might remember him . I may have seen him and have news of him : heaven knows , I�ve wandered far enough . � / 
The master swineherd 
replied : �Old man , no traveller�s tale will satisfy his wife or his brave son : in fact every beggar in need of a meal invents some lie at random , not caring if it�s true . Whoever reaches 
Ithaca in his wanderings goes to my mistress and deceives her with his stories . She welcomes them all in her kindness , shows them hospitality , and questions them endlessly , while she weeps as women do when their husband dies far off , the tears streaming from her eyes . 
You too would invent a tale fast enough , old man , if it brought you a tunic and cloak . as for my master , his spirit has flown by now , and the dogs and birds have stripped the flesh from his limbs , or the fishes have had him , and his bones are veiled in sand on some deep shore . 
He has perished far off , and left his friends to grieve , I most of all , since however far I travel I�ll never find so good a master , not even if I reached my parent�s house , that place where I was born and where 
they reared me . 
Much as I grieve for them , eager though I am to see them , and visit my native land again , longing instead for the lost 
Odysseus grips me . 
Even though he is not here , 
Stranger , I am ashamed to merely name him , so greatly did he love me and care for me . Rather I will call him �noble friend� , though he cannot hear me . � / 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus 
replied : �Friend , since you deny the fact , and declare he will never return , since your mind refuses to accept it , I will not merely say it I will swear that 
Odysseus shall come home . 
And when he does , let me have my reward then for bringing good news , and dress me then in fine clothes , tunic and cloak . but until that day despite my need I will take nothing : for that man is as hateful to my eyes as the 
Gates of 
Hades who is driven to tell a lying tale because of poverty�s burden . 
Now 
Zeus above all the gods be my witness , and this hospitable table , and this hearth of good 
Odysseus I have come to , that in truth all this will happen as I say . This very month , between the old moon and the new , 
Odysseus will be here . 
He will return , and revenge himself on those who dishonour his wife and his noble son . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered him then , saying : �There�s no way I�ll ever be able to reward you for that good news , old man : 
Odysseus will never return . drink in peace , and let�s turn our thoughts to other things instead : stop reminding me of it all . 
My heart grieves so whenever anyone speaks of my good master . as for your oath , let it rest , and may 
Odysseus return , as I desire , I and 
Penelope and 
Laertes that old man , and divine 
Telemachus . 
Telemachus , the son , he is the one I grieve for endlessly now . 
The gods made him grow like a young sapling , and I thought he�d be like his brave and handsome father in action , but some man or god addled his mind , and foolishly he went to sacred 
Pylos seeking news . 
The princely 
Suitors will ambush him on his way home and godlike Arceisius� race will vanish from 
Ithaca , without a trace . 
Whether he�s taken or escapes there�s nothing we can do though : may 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , reach out a hand to save him . / but tell me of your own troubles , old man . tell me in truth , so I may clearly know it , who you are and where you come from . 
Who are your parents and where�s your 
city ? 
What sort of ship was it that brought you to 
Ithaca , since one can�t get here on foot ? 
Where did its crew claim to be from ? � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �I will tell you the plain truth , and though we had food and sweet wine for a year , so we could feast in your hut while others did the work , I would still not have time to tell all my sorrows , all I have suffered by the gods� will . / I am the son of a wealthy man , and a native of Crete�s broad island . 
He had many other sons , born and bred in his house , legitimate sons of his lawful wife , while my mother was his bought concubine . but castor son of 
Hylax , my father , treated me the same as his other sons . 
He was honoured like a god by the 
Cretans for his wealth , position , and splendid children , but fate took him , death carried him off to Hades� house , and his proud sons cast lots for their portions of his estate . 
They granted me a tiny share , with a hut to match . but by my courage I won a wife from a wealthy house , since I was no coward or weakling in battle . All that strength has gone , now , for truly I have met with my full measure of sorrows , but maybe you can judge the harvest from the stubble . ares and 
Athene gave me courage then , and power to break the enemy ranks , and whenever I sowed trouble , picking the best of my men for an ambush , my proud spirit never thought of death . I was ever the first to attack , and kill with my spear whichever of the enemy ran from me . I was a fighting man . a life of labour on the land would never have suited me , nor would a house , even if it was full of handsome children . I loved war , and the oared ships , shining spears and arrows , fateful things that make others shudder . but I suppose a god set the love of all that in my heart , since different men take delight in different occupations . / I had led men and swift ships nine times in foreign expeditions , before ever the sons of Achaea set foot on the soil of 
Troy , and always treasure came to my hands . I would take what pleased me : and more still fell to me by lot . 
So my wealth grew , and I was honoured and feared by the 
Cretans . � / �But when far-thundering 
Zeus plotted the fatal voyage that meant the death of so many fighting men , 
they asked glorious Idomeneus and myself to lead their ships to 
Troy , and the people clamoured so , there was no way to refuse . for nine years we sons of Achaea fought there , and sacked the 
city of 
Priam in the tenth , then we sailed for home but a god scattered the fleet . 
Wretch that I am , 
Zeus the counsellor planned trouble for me . I only had a month to enjoy my children , wife , and wealth , before the idea took me to fit out my ships in full , and sail to Egypt with noble friends . I readied nine vessels , and the company soon gathered . 
Then I offered my comrades suitable victims so 
they could sacrifice to the gods , and feast , and the feasting lasted six days . on the seventh we boarded and sailed from broad 
Crete , with a fresh and fair 
North 
Wind behind , and ran on swiftly like boats sliding downstream . Our ships came to no harm , and unscathed , untouched by illness , we sat on deck while the wind and the helmsman guided them . / on the fifth day we reached the great Egyptian river , and there in the 
Nile I moored my curved ships . 
Then I told my loyal companions to stay and guard them , while I sent scouts to find the highest ground . but my crews , feeling confident , and succumbing to temptation , set about plundering the Egyptians� fine fields , carrying off women and children , and killing the men till their cries reached the 
city . 
Hearing the shouting the people poured out at dawn and filled the plain with infantry , and chariots , and the gleam of bronze . 
Zeus who hurls the lightning bolt filled my men with abject fear , and not one had the courage to face the enemy who threatened us on all sides , or hold his ground . 
Then 
they killed many of us with their bronze weapons , and dragged the rest off to the 
city as slaves . as for myself , 
Zeus inspired me � though it would have been better to die in Egypt , since sorrow was waiting for me . / I swiftly doffed my fine helmet , and shield , and let the spear drop from my hand , and ran towards the King�s chariot . 
There I clasped his knees and kissed them , and he took pity on me and saved me , taking me weeping into his chariot and driving off . as you might imagine , many men lunged at me with their ash-wood spears , eager to kill me in their great anger , but he kept them away , for fear of the wrath of 
Zeus the god of strangers , who is most indignant of all the gods at cruel deeds . / I remained there seven years and became wealthy , since the Egyptians were generous in their gifts . but during the eighth year I met a wily 
Phoenician , a greedy rogue , who had already caused much trouble in the world . 
His cunning deceived me , and he took me with him to 
Phoenicia , where he owned a house and goods , and there I stayed a whole year . � / �But when days and months had passed , and the year had rolled round with its seasons , he took me aboard a seagoing ship bound for 
Libya , on the pretext that I was needed to help him with the cargo , but in reality to sell me for a good price when he arrived . 
Though suspecting his evil intent , I had no choice but to embark . / She ran before a fine fresh northerly , over the wide seas south of 
Crete , while 
Zeus planned our destruction . 
When we had left 
Crete behind and could see nothing but waves and sky , the son of 
Cronos covered the hollow ship with black cloud , so that the sea beneath her grew dark . 
And then 
Zeus thundered and hurled his lightning at the vessel , so that she quivered from stem to stern at the stroke , and filled with sulphurous smoke , while all were thrown overboard . 
The others floated round the black ship like gulls , and the god denied them their homecoming . but as I struggled , surrounded by disaster , 
Zeus himself flung the storm-tossed mast of the dark-prowed ship within my reach , so I might escape death again . I clung to it , driven by the strong winds . Nine days I drifted , but on the tenth night of darkness a huge breaker drove me onto 
Thesprotia�s shore . The 
King of the 
Thesprotians , 
Pheidon the hero , received me and demanded no ransom . 
His brave son had found me , overcome by cold and weariness , and taking me by the hand led me to his father�s palace , where he clothed me in a tunic and cloak . / It was there I heard of 
Odysseus . 
The 
King said he had welcomed him and shown him hospitality as he headed for home . 
And he showed me the wealth 
Odysseus had garnered , gold and bronze and forged iron , so great a pile that what was stored in the King�s treasury would feed a man and his heirs to the tenth generation . 
Odysseus , he said , had left for 
Dodona , to learn Zeus� will from the great oak tree sacred to the god , as to how he should return , openly or in secret , to Ithaca�s rich isle , after his long absence . 
Moreover as he poured libations in his house , in my presence , he swore that a ship and crew were standing by to carry 
Odysseus to his native land . but he sent me off first since a 
Thesprotian vessel was setting out for corn-rich 
Dulichium . 
He ordered the crew to treat me with kindness , and take me to 
Acastus , its king . / but 
they were possessed of an evil thought , and the result to me was utter misery . 
When the seagoing ship was far from land , 
they set about reducing me to slavery . 
They stripped me of my tunic and cloak , and gave me a ragged shirt , all the tattered garments you see before you . At evening we reached the cultivated fields of bright 
Ithaca . 
Then 
they tied me fast to the benched ship with a coil of rope , and went ashore to make a quick meal by the water . but the gods untied the rope , and wrapping myself in the tattered cloak , I slid down the gangplank and breasted the waves , striking out with both hands , till I could leave the water and escape . 
Then I found a leafy thicket inland , and crouched there . 
They searched here and there , shouting , but deciding nothing would be gained by prolonging the search , 
they went back on board the hollow ship . 
The gods kept me easily concealed , and led me to a good man�s farm , since it seems it�s my fate to stay alive . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered him , saying : �My poor man , you have moved my heart deeply with this tale of your hardships and travels . but I don�t think what you say of 
Odysseus can be true , and it won�t convince me . 
Why , given your circumstances , do you lie , pointlessly ? as far as my master�s homecoming is concerned I know the gods hated my master utterly , not letting him die fighting the 
Trojans , or in the arms of his friends when the war had ended . 
Leaving his son a famous name the whole 
Achaean army would have built his tomb . but the powers of the tempest have swept him ingloriously away . / I live far-off here with the swine and never go near the 
city , unless news comes to wise 
Penelope , and she asks me there . 
Then a crowd gathers round the news-bearer , questioning him closely , all who grieve for their long-absent lord , and all who joy in consuming his wealth un-punished . but I have ceased to probe and enquire , ever since an 
Aetolian who wandered the wide world came to my hut one day . I showed him hospitality and he deceived me with tales . 
He said he had seen 
Odysseus among those same 
Cretans , in Idomeneus� palace , while his storm-beaten ships were being repaired . 
He 
claimed 
Odysseus would be here by summer harvest , along with his comrades , weighed-down with treasure . 
So don�t you try to reassure me and get round me with your lies too my long-suffering friend , whom some god has brought here to my house . 
That won�t make me show you respect and kindness , while fear of 
Zeus the god of strangers , and pity for you , will . � / 
Subtle 
Odysseus 
replied : �That heart in your breast is hard to convince , that�s for certain , seeing not even my oath could sway or persuade you . but now , let us strike a bargain , and let the 
Olympian gods be our witness in time to come . if your master returns home clothe me in tunic and cloak , and send me on to 
Dulichium , my destination . but if he should not return despite my prophecy , set your men on me and hurl me from the cliffs , so the next beggar takes care not to try and deceive . � / �Oh yes , 
Stranger , � the honest swineherd said in answer : �that would be a fine way indeed to win everlasting fame and honour among men , to turn murderer , and rob you of your precious life , after I�ve taken you into my house and played the host ! I could pray to 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , with a light heart after that ! 
Come , it is time to eat , and I trust my friends will be here soon , so we can make a pleasant meal of it in my hut . � / as 
they spoke to each other , the herdsmen arrived with their swine . 
They drove the sows , grunting loudly , into their sties to sleep , as usual , and the honest swineherd shouted to his men : �Bring the best hog , so I can slaughter it for a guest who has come from afar . 
We can enjoy it too , we who have toiled long and hard for the sake of these white-tusked boars , while others consume the results of our efforts for free . � / 
Saying this , he began to split wood with his sharp bronze axe , while the rest dragged a fat five year old hog up to the hearth and held it there . 
The good-hearted swineherd remembered the gods , and threw bristles from the white-tusked boar�s head into the fire as a first offering , while he prayed that wise 
Odysseus might return home in safety . 
Then he drew himself up and struck the boar with an un-split billet of oak to kill it . 
Then the others slit its throat , singed it , and swiftly butchered the carcass . 
The swineherd cut flesh from each of the limbs as first offerings , and wrapped the pieces in rich fat , sprinkled them with barley meal , and threw them into the flames . 
The rest 
they jointed , and roasted carefully on spits , drew the meat from the skewers and piled it on great platters . 
The swineherd , a stickler for fairness , stood up and divided it into seven portions , setting one aside with a prayer for the 
Nymphs , and for 
Hermes , Maia�s son , and distributing the rest , honouring 
Odysseus with the white-tusked boar�s long chine . / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus , his master , was touched by this and said : �Eumaeus , may 
Father 
Zeus be as kind to you as you are to me , since you honour me with the prime cut , wretch though I am . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you 
replied : �Eat , my pious guest , and enjoy whatever is here . 
The god it is who gives us one thing , and holds back another , since he has the power to do as he wishes . � / 
With this , he offered the first portion to the eternal gods , and making a libation of glowing wine , placed the cup in the hands of that sacker of cities , 
Odysseus , and sat down to his own meal . 
Bread was served out by 
Mesaulius , a slave the swineherd had acquired himself in Odysseus� absence , without Penelope�s or old Laertes� knowledge . 
He had bought him from the 
Taphians with his own assets . 
Then 
they all reached for the good food set before them . 
When 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , 
Mesaulius removed what was left , and having eaten and drunk their fill 
they readied themselves for sleep . / 
Night came on , moonless and stormy . 
Zeus sent a strong , rain-bearing 
West 
Wind , and it poured the whole night through . 
Odysseus thought to test the swineherd , and see , since he showed such care for his guest , whether he would give him his cloak , or ask one of his men to do so . �Eumaeus , � he said , �and all you men , listen while I tell you a brave tale : the wine it is that prompts me , wine that makes a fool of the wise and sets a man to singing or laughing stupidly , drags him to his feet for a dance , or makes him blurt out words that are better left unspoken . 
Well , I�ve started to speak , so I�ll not stifle them . / 
How I wish I were young and strong as I was when we set out to spring an ambush under the walls of 
Troy . 
We were led by 
Odysseus , and 
Menelaus , Atreus�s son , and I was ordered to be the third in command . 
We crouched there behind our weapons in thick brush among swamps and reeds , near to the high-walled 
city . 
The 
North 
Wind 
dropped and the night grew fiercely cold , and snow like hoar-frost settled on us , with a bitter chill so the ice formed thick on our shields . 
Now , all the others had tunics and cloaks , and slept easily with their shields protecting their shoulders , but I�d stupidly left my cloak behind when I set out with my men , taking only my gleaming metal belt and my shield , not thinking then I would be cold . / but in the third watch of night , when the stars had passed the zenith , I nudged 
Odysseus who lay next to me , with my elbow , and he listened while I spoke : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , I am not long for this life : I�ve no cloak , and the cold is killing me . Some god persuaded me to wear a tunic only , and there�s no escaping this frost . � / 
Hearing this , and being a great schemer as well as fighter , he hit on an idea , and speaking softly said : �Quiet now , lest one of our 
Achaeans realises you are awake . � 
And with this he raised himself on his elbow , and called out : �Friends , I have had a dream that the gods sent in my sleep . 
They warned me we are dangerously far from the shore . 
We need someone to alert 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son and our commander , in the hope he will order more men here from the ships . � / At this , 
Thoas , Andraemon�s son , leapt up , flung off his purple cloak , and ran for the camp . I lay there , snugly wrapped in his garment , till golden-throned 
Dawn appeared ! oh , I wish I were young and strong as I once was : then perhaps some swineherd would present me with a cloak , out of kindness and respect for a fine man . as it is 
they scorn me and my rags . � / 
Eumaus , the swineherd , you answered him then , saying : �A good tale , old man , and there�s nothing wrong with its message : it wasn�t lost on us . 
You won�t lack clothing , or anything else a weary suppliant deserves from those he meets , tonight at least . but in the morning you�ll have to engage with those rags of yours . We�ve no spare cloaks here or changes of tunic : each has just the one . but when Odysseus� brave son returns he�ll give you a tunic and cloak to wear , and send you on wherever your heart and mind desire . � / 
With this he leapt up and made a bed for 
Odysseus nearer the fire , throwing sheep and goatskins over it . 
Then 
Odysseus lay down again , and the swineherd covered him with a big thick blanket , that he kept there for a dry covering after a fierce storm . / 
There 
Odysseus could sleep , next to the younger men . but the swineherd was averse to staying there away from his hogs , and prepared to go outside . 
Odysseus was delighted to see him take such care of his master�s herd in his absence . 
He watched 
Eumaeus sling a sharp sword over his sturdy shoulders , wrap himself in his thick cloak against the wind , pick up the fleece of a well-fed full-grown goat , and a spear to drive off dogs and men , and go out to sleep where the white-tusked boars slept , under an overhanging rock , sheltered from northerly winds . / 
Odysseus followed a rough track from the harbour , leading through the woods and over the hills , to the place where 
Athene had said he would find the faithful swineherd , the most loyal of all the servants 
Odysseus had acquired . 
He found him indeed , sitting in the yard in front of his hut which was built high up , on a site with a wide view , in a broad yard in the centre of a clearing . 
The swineherd had constructed it himself to hold his absent master�s swine , without his mistress� or old Laertes� knowledge . 
He had laid huge stones and topped the walls with a hedge of thorn . Beyond them he had set large close-set stakes along each side , oak stakes split to the black heart of the tree , then he had built twelve sties close together inside the yard to hold the pigs , and there were fifty breeding sows penned , wallowing there , in each . 
The boars slept outside , and there were far fewer of these since the noble 
Suitors had thinned out their numbers with their feasting , the swineherd sending them the pick of the fatted hogs . 
There were three hundred and sixty , guarded by four hounds fierce as wolves , reared by the master swineherd . / 
He himself was trimming a piece of well-tanned ox-hide , and shaping a pair of sandals for his feet while three of his men had gone out in different directions driving the swine and a fourth delivered a boar to the arrogant 
Suitors so 
they might slaughter it and enjoy the flesh . / Suddenly the dogs bayed at the sight of 
Odysseus , and rushed at him barking loudly , but he had the wit to sit down and drop his staff . 
Even then he might have been badly mauled in his own farmyard if the swineherd had not followed them swiftly , the leather falling from his hand , and hurried to the gateway , calling out to his dogs and scattering them with a shower of stones . 
Then he addressed his disguised master : �Old man , these dogs could have torn your flesh in a moment , and you would have blamed me ! as if the gods had not given me pain and grief enough . Here I am , fattening swine for other men to eat , while the godlike master I mourn for may be wandering in hunger through foreign cities and lands : that is if he�s still alive under the sun . but come to the hut with me , old man , and when you have quenched your hunger and thirst you can tell me where you come from , and all the troubles you�ve suffered . � / 
With this the faithful swineherd led the way to the hut , and ushered 
Odysseus in , then sat him down after making a pile of thick brushwood and spreading the large and shaggy skin of a wild goat on top , that served him for a bed . 
Odysseus was glad of his reception , and thanked him , saying : �May 
Zeus and the other gods give you your heart�s desire , sir , since you welcome me so warmly . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you it was who answered 
Odysseus , saying : �Stranger , it would be wrong for me to turn a guest away , even one in a worse state than you , since every beggar and stranger is from 
Zeus , and a gift , though small , from such folk as us is welcome . 
Small it must be , since that is the servants� lot , always living in fear of the masters who lord it over them , I mean young masters like ours . 
The gods have thwarted my old master�s homecoming . 
He would have cared for me with kindness , and given me things of my own , a hut and a piece of land , and a wife worthy of having been courted by many men , things a kind master grants a servant who has laboured on his behalf and whose efforts the gods favour , just as 
they further my efforts here . 
My master would have rewarded me well , indeed , had he grown old here in 
Ithaca . but he has perished , as I wish 
Helen and all her race had utterly perished , since she was the death of many a fine warrior . 
He went to ilium , famed for its horses , with all the other warriors to fight those 
Trojans , on Agamemnon�s voyage of vengeance . � / 
Saying this , he fastened his tunic with a belt , and went off to the sties where the pigs were penned . Picking two , he dragged them in , slaughtered and singed them both , then jointed and spitted them . 
When all was roasted , he served it to 
Odysseus piping hot on the skewers , sprinkling the meat with white barley meal . 
Then he mixed honey-sweet wine in an ivy-wood bowl , and sat down himself opposite 
Odysseus , saying 
invitingly : �Eat , the food , 
Stranger , that a servant can provide , sucking pig , since the pitiless 
Suitors , careless of the gods� anger , take my fatted hogs . 
Yet the blessed gods do not approve of such wanton acts : 
they honour justice and decency . 
Even men who set foot on hostile soil , owing their enemies nothing , whom 
Zeus allows to gather spoils , to fill their ships and head for home , even in their hearts the fear of divine anger stirs . but these men here must have heard the voice of some god announcing my master�s sad death , seeing 
they neither pay genuine court , nor return to their homes , but waste our possessions arrogantly , as 
they wish , sparing nothing . 
They slaughter the beasts every night and day that 
Zeus sends , and not just one or two , and 
they draw what wine 
they need and more . / 
My master was truly rich : no warrior on 
Ithaca or the dark-soiled mainland could compete , not twenty put together . I�ll describe it all : twelve cattle herds and as many flocks of sheep and droves of swine , there on the mainland , and as many roving herds of goats , all tended by locals or by foreign herdsmen . 
And on the shores of 
Ithaca here , eleven herds of goats graze , guarded by faithful men . 
And each day every man has to send the fattest of his goats along to the 
Suitors , while I the swineherd pick out the best of the boars for them . � / 
While he spoke , a grateful and ravenous 
Odysseus ate the meat and drank the wine , planning trouble for the 
Suitors . 
When he had sated his hunger and was done with eating , the swineherd filled his own drinking bowl again and offered it brimming with wine , and 
Odysseus took it gladly , and addressed him with winged words : �Who was this rich and powerful man , 
Friend , who bought you with his wealth ? 
You say he died winning vengeance for 
Agamemnon : name him , perhaps I might remember him . I may have seen him and have news of him : heaven knows , I�ve wandered far enough . � / 
The master swineherd 
replied : �Old man , no traveller�s tale will satisfy his wife or his brave son : in fact every beggar in need of a meal invents some lie at random , not caring if it�s true . Whoever reaches 
Ithaca in his wanderings goes to my mistress and deceives her with his stories . She welcomes them all in her kindness , shows them hospitality , and questions them endlessly , while she weeps as women do when their husband dies far off , the tears streaming from her eyes . 
You too would invent a tale fast enough , old man , if it brought you a tunic and cloak . as for my master , his spirit has flown by now , and the dogs and birds have stripped the flesh from his limbs , or the fishes have had him , and his bones are veiled in sand on some deep shore . 
He has perished far off , and left his friends to grieve , I most of all , since however far I travel I�ll never find so good a master , not even if I reached my parent�s house , that place where I was born and where 
they reared me . 
Much as I grieve for them , eager though I am to see them , and visit my native land again , longing instead for the lost 
Odysseus grips me . 
Even though he is not here , 
Stranger , I am ashamed to merely name him , so greatly did he love me and care for me . Rather I will call him �noble friend� , though he cannot hear me . � / 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus 
replied : �Friend , since you deny the fact , and declare he will never return , since your mind refuses to accept it , I will not merely say it I will swear that 
Odysseus shall come home . 
And when he does , let me have my reward then for bringing good news , and dress me then in fine clothes , tunic and cloak . but until that day despite my need I will take nothing : for that man is as hateful to my eyes as the 
Gates of 
Hades who is driven to tell a lying tale because of poverty�s burden . 
Now 
Zeus above all the gods be my witness , and this hospitable table , and this hearth of good 
Odysseus I have come to , that in truth all this will happen as I say . This very month , between the old moon and the new , 
Odysseus will be here . 
He will return , and revenge himself on those who dishonour his wife and his noble son . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered him then , saying : �There�s no way I�ll ever be able to reward you for that good news , old man : 
Odysseus will never return . drink in peace , and let�s turn our thoughts to other things instead : stop reminding me of it all . 
My heart grieves so whenever anyone speaks of my good master . as for your oath , let it rest , and may 
Odysseus return , as I desire , I and 
Penelope and 
Laertes that old man , and divine 
Telemachus . 
Telemachus , the son , he is the one I grieve for endlessly now . 
The gods made him grow like a young sapling , and I thought he�d be like his brave and handsome father in action , but some man or god addled his mind , and foolishly he went to sacred 
Pylos seeking news . 
The princely 
Suitors will ambush him on his way home and godlike Arceisius� race will vanish from 
Ithaca , without a trace . 
Whether he�s taken or escapes there�s nothing we can do though : may 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , reach out a hand to save him . / but tell me of your own troubles , old man . tell me in truth , so I may clearly know it , who you are and where you come from . 
Who are your parents and where�s your 
city ? 
What sort of ship was it that brought you to 
Ithaca , since one can�t get here on foot ? 
Where did its crew claim to be from ? � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �I will tell you the plain truth , and though we had food and sweet wine for a year , so we could feast in your hut while others did the work , I would still not have time to tell all my sorrows , all I have suffered by the gods� will . / I am the son of a wealthy man , and a native of Crete�s broad island . 
He had many other sons , born and bred in his house , legitimate sons of his lawful wife , while my mother was his bought concubine . but castor son of 
Hylax , my father , treated me the same as his other sons . 
He was honoured like a god by the 
Cretans for his wealth , position , and splendid children , but fate took him , death carried him off to Hades� house , and his proud sons cast lots for their portions of his estate . 
They granted me a tiny share , with a hut to match . but by my courage I won a wife from a wealthy house , since I was no coward or weakling in battle . All that strength has gone , now , for truly I have met with my full measure of sorrows , but maybe you can judge the harvest from the stubble . ares and 
Athene gave me courage then , and power to break the enemy ranks , and whenever I sowed trouble , picking the best of my men for an ambush , my proud spirit never thought of death . I was ever the first to attack , and kill with my spear whichever of the enemy ran from me . I was a fighting man . a life of labour on the land would never have suited me , nor would a house , even if it was full of handsome children . I loved war , and the oared ships , shining spears and arrows , fateful things that make others shudder . but I suppose a god set the love of all that in my heart , since different men take delight in different occupations . / I had led men and swift ships nine times in foreign expeditions , before ever the sons of Achaea set foot on the soil of 
Troy , and always treasure came to my hands . I would take what pleased me : and more still fell to me by lot . 
So my wealth grew , and I was honoured and feared by the 
Cretans . � / �But when far-thundering 
Zeus plotted the fatal voyage that meant the death of so many fighting men , 
they asked glorious Idomeneus and myself to lead their ships to 
Troy , and the people clamoured so , there was no way to refuse . for nine years we sons of Achaea fought there , and sacked the 
city of 
Priam in the tenth , then we sailed for home but a god scattered the fleet . 
Wretch that I am , 
Zeus the counsellor planned trouble for me . I only had a month to enjoy my children , wife , and wealth , before the idea took me to fit out my ships in full , and sail to Egypt with noble friends . I readied nine vessels , and the company soon gathered . 
Then I offered my comrades suitable victims so 
they could sacrifice to the gods , and feast , and the feasting lasted six days . on the seventh we boarded and sailed from broad 
Crete , with a fresh and fair 
North 
Wind behind , and ran on swiftly like boats sliding downstream . Our ships came to no harm , and unscathed , untouched by illness , we sat on deck while the wind and the helmsman guided them . / on the fifth day we reached the great Egyptian river , and there in the 
Nile I moored my curved ships . 
Then I told my loyal companions to stay and guard them , while I sent scouts to find the highest ground . but my crews , feeling confident , and succumbing to temptation , set about plundering the Egyptians� fine fields , carrying off women and children , and killing the men till their cries reached the 
city . 
Hearing the shouting the people poured out at dawn and filled the plain with infantry , and chariots , and the gleam of bronze . 
Zeus who hurls the lightning bolt filled my men with abject fear , and not one had the courage to face the enemy who threatened us on all sides , or hold his ground . 
Then 
they killed many of us with their bronze weapons , and dragged the rest off to the 
city as slaves . as for myself , 
Zeus inspired me � though it would have been better to die in Egypt , since sorrow was waiting for me . / I swiftly doffed my fine helmet , and shield , and let the spear drop from my hand , and ran towards the King�s chariot . 
There I clasped his knees and kissed them , and he took pity on me and saved me , taking me weeping into his chariot and driving off . as you might imagine , many men lunged at me with their ash-wood spears , eager to kill me in their great anger , but he kept them away , for fear of the wrath of 
Zeus the god of strangers , who is most indignant of all the gods at cruel deeds . / I remained there seven years and became wealthy , since the Egyptians were generous in their gifts . but during the eighth year I met a wily 
Phoenician , a greedy rogue , who had already caused much trouble in the world . 
His cunning deceived me , and he took me with him to 
Phoenicia , where he owned a house and goods , and there I stayed a whole year . � / �But when days and months had passed , and the year had rolled round with its seasons , he took me aboard a seagoing ship bound for 
Libya , on the pretext that I was needed to help him with the cargo , but in reality to sell me for a good price when he arrived . 
Though suspecting his evil intent , I had no choice but to embark . / She ran before a fine fresh northerly , over the wide seas south of 
Crete , while 
Zeus planned our destruction . 
When we had left 
Crete behind and could see nothing but waves and sky , the son of 
Cronos covered the hollow ship with black cloud , so that the sea beneath her grew dark . 
And then 
Zeus thundered and hurled his lightning at the vessel , so that she quivered from stem to stern at the stroke , and filled with sulphurous smoke , while all were thrown overboard . 
The others floated round the black ship like gulls , and the god denied them their homecoming . but as I struggled , surrounded by disaster , 
Zeus himself flung the storm-tossed mast of the dark-prowed ship within my reach , so I might escape death again . I clung to it , driven by the strong winds . Nine days I drifted , but on the tenth night of darkness a huge breaker drove me onto 
Thesprotia�s shore . The 
King of the 
Thesprotians , 
Pheidon the hero , received me and demanded no ransom . 
His brave son had found me , overcome by cold and weariness , and taking me by the hand led me to his father�s palace , where he clothed me in a tunic and cloak . / It was there I heard of 
Odysseus . 
The 
King said he had welcomed him and shown him hospitality as he headed for home . 
And he showed me the wealth 
Odysseus had garnered , gold and bronze and forged iron , so great a pile that what was stored in the King�s treasury would feed a man and his heirs to the tenth generation . 
Odysseus , he said , had left for 
Dodona , to learn Zeus� will from the great oak tree sacred to the god , as to how he should return , openly or in secret , to Ithaca�s rich isle , after his long absence . 
Moreover as he poured libations in his house , in my presence , he swore that a ship and crew were standing by to carry 
Odysseus to his native land . but he sent me off first since a 
Thesprotian vessel was setting out for corn-rich 
Dulichium . 
He ordered the crew to treat me with kindness , and take me to 
Acastus , its king . / but 
they were possessed of an evil thought , and the result to me was utter misery . 
When the seagoing ship was far from land , 
they set about reducing me to slavery . 
They stripped me of my tunic and cloak , and gave me a ragged shirt , all the tattered garments you see before you . At evening we reached the cultivated fields of bright 
Ithaca . 
Then 
they tied me fast to the benched ship with a coil of rope , and went ashore to make a quick meal by the water . but the gods untied the rope , and wrapping myself in the tattered cloak , I slid down the gangplank and breasted the waves , striking out with both hands , till I could leave the water and escape . 
Then I found a leafy thicket inland , and crouched there . 
They searched here and there , shouting , but deciding nothing would be gained by prolonging the search , 
they went back on board the hollow ship . 
The gods kept me easily concealed , and led me to a good man�s farm , since it seems it�s my fate to stay alive . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you answered him , saying : �My poor man , you have moved my heart deeply with this tale of your hardships and travels . but I don�t think what you say of 
Odysseus can be true , and it won�t convince me . 
Why , given your circumstances , do you lie , pointlessly ? as far as my master�s homecoming is concerned I know the gods hated my master utterly , not letting him die fighting the 
Trojans , or in the arms of his friends when the war had ended . 
Leaving his son a famous name the whole 
Achaean army would have built his tomb . but the powers of the tempest have swept him ingloriously away . / I live far-off here with the swine and never go near the 
city , unless news comes to wise 
Penelope , and she asks me there . 
Then a crowd gathers round the news-bearer , questioning him closely , all who grieve for their long-absent lord , and all who joy in consuming his wealth un-punished . but I have ceased to probe and enquire , ever since an 
Aetolian who wandered the wide world came to my hut one day . I showed him hospitality and he deceived me with tales . 
He said he had seen 
Odysseus among those same 
Cretans , in Idomeneus� palace , while his storm-beaten ships were being repaired . 
He 
claimed 
Odysseus would be here by summer harvest , along with his comrades , weighed-down with treasure . 
So don�t you try to reassure me and get round me with your lies too my long-suffering friend , whom some god has brought here to my house . 
That won�t make me show you respect and kindness , while fear of 
Zeus the god of strangers , and pity for you , will . � / 
Subtle 
Odysseus 
replied : �That heart in your breast is hard to convince , that�s for certain , seeing not even my oath could sway or persuade you . but now , let us strike a bargain , and let the 
Olympian gods be our witness in time to come . if your master returns home clothe me in tunic and cloak , and send me on to 
Dulichium , my destination . but if he should not return despite my prophecy , set your men on me and hurl me from the cliffs , so the next beggar takes care not to try and deceive . � / �Oh yes , 
Stranger , � the honest swineherd said in answer : �that would be a fine way indeed to win everlasting fame and honour among men , to turn murderer , and rob you of your precious life , after I�ve taken you into my house and played the host ! I could pray to 
Zeus , son of 
Cronos , with a light heart after that ! 
Come , it is time to eat , and I trust my friends will be here soon , so we can make a pleasant meal of it in my hut . � / as 
they spoke to each other , the herdsmen arrived with their swine . 
They drove the sows , grunting loudly , into their sties to sleep , as usual , and the honest swineherd shouted to his men : �Bring the best hog , so I can slaughter it for a guest who has come from afar . 
We can enjoy it too , we who have toiled long and hard for the sake of these white-tusked boars , while others consume the results of our efforts for free . � / 
Saying this , he began to split wood with his sharp bronze axe , while the rest dragged a fat five year old hog up to the hearth and held it there . 
The good-hearted swineherd remembered the gods , and threw bristles from the white-tusked boar�s head into the fire as a first offering , while he prayed that wise 
Odysseus might return home in safety . 
Then he drew himself up and struck the boar with an un-split billet of oak to kill it . 
Then the others slit its throat , singed it , and swiftly butchered the carcass . 
The swineherd cut flesh from each of the limbs as first offerings , and wrapped the pieces in rich fat , sprinkled them with barley meal , and threw them into the flames . 
The rest 
they jointed , and roasted carefully on spits , drew the meat from the skewers and piled it on great platters . 
The swineherd , a stickler for fairness , stood up and divided it into seven portions , setting one aside with a prayer for the 
Nymphs , and for 
Hermes , Maia�s son , and distributing the rest , honouring 
Odysseus with the white-tusked boar�s long chine . / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus , his master , was touched by this and said : �Eumaeus , may 
Father 
Zeus be as kind to you as you are to me , since you honour me with the prime cut , wretch though I am . � / 
Eumaeus , the swineherd , you 
replied : �Eat , my pious guest , and enjoy whatever is here . 
The god it is who gives us one thing , and holds back another , since he has the power to do as he wishes . � / 
With this , he offered the first portion to the eternal gods , and making a libation of glowing wine , placed the cup in the hands of that sacker of cities , 
Odysseus , and sat down to his own meal . 
Bread was served out by 
Mesaulius , a slave the swineherd had acquired himself in Odysseus� absence , without Penelope�s or old Laertes� knowledge . 
He had bought him from the 
Taphians with his own assets . 
Then 
they all reached for the good food set before them . 
When 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , 
Mesaulius removed what was left , and having eaten and drunk their fill 
they readied themselves for sleep . / 
Night came on , moonless and stormy . 
Zeus sent a strong , rain-bearing 
West 
Wind , and it poured the whole night through . 
Odysseus thought to test the swineherd , and see , since he showed such care for his guest , whether he would give him his cloak , or ask one of his men to do so . �Eumaeus , � he said , �and all you men , listen while I tell you a brave tale : the wine it is that prompts me , wine that makes a fool of the wise and sets a man to singing or laughing stupidly , drags him to his feet for a dance , or makes him blurt out words that are better left unspoken . 
Well , I�ve started to speak , so I�ll not stifle them . / 
How I wish I were young and strong as I was when we set out to spring an ambush under the walls of 
Troy . 
We were led by 
Odysseus , and 
Menelaus , Atreus�s son , and I was ordered to be the third in command . 
We crouched there behind our weapons in thick brush among swamps and reeds , near to the high-walled 
city . 
The 
North 
Wind 
dropped and the night grew fiercely cold , and snow like hoar-frost settled on us , with a bitter chill so the ice formed thick on our shields . 
Now , all the others had tunics and cloaks , and slept easily with their shields protecting their shoulders , but I�d stupidly left my cloak behind when I set out with my men , taking only my gleaming metal belt and my shield , not thinking then I would be cold . / but in the third watch of night , when the stars had passed the zenith , I nudged 
Odysseus who lay next to me , with my elbow , and he listened while I spoke : �Odysseus of many resources , scion of 
Zeus , son of 
Laertes , I am not long for this life : I�ve no cloak , and the cold is killing me . Some god persuaded me to wear a tunic only , and there�s no escaping this frost . � / 
Hearing this , and being a great schemer as well as fighter , he hit on an idea , and speaking softly said : �Quiet now , lest one of our 
Achaeans realises you are awake . � 
And with this he raised himself on his elbow , and called out : �Friends , I have had a dream that the gods sent in my sleep . 
They warned me we are dangerously far from the shore . 
We need someone to alert 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son and our commander , in the hope he will order more men here from the ships . � / At this , 
Thoas , Andraemon�s son , leapt up , flung off his purple cloak , and ran for the camp . I lay there , snugly wrapped in his garment , till golden-throned 
Dawn appeared ! oh , I wish I were young and strong as I once was : then perhaps some swineherd would present me with a cloak , out of kindness and respect for a fine man . as it is 
they scorn me and my rags . � / 
Eumaus , the swineherd , you answered him then , saying : �A good tale , old man , and there�s nothing wrong with its message : it wasn�t lost on us . 
You won�t lack clothing , or anything else a weary suppliant deserves from those he meets , tonight at least . but in the morning you�ll have to engage with those rags of yours . We�ve no spare cloaks here or changes of tunic : each has just the one . but when Odysseus� brave son returns he�ll give you a tunic and cloak to wear , and send you on wherever your heart and mind desire . � / 
With this he leapt up and made a bed for 
Odysseus nearer the fire , throwing sheep and goatskins over it . 
Then 
Odysseus lay down again , and the swineherd covered him with a big thick blanket , that he kept there for a dry covering after a fierce storm . / 
There 
Odysseus could sleep , next to the younger men . but the swineherd was averse to staying there away from his hogs , and prepared to go outside . 
Odysseus was delighted to see him take such care of his master�s herd in his absence . 
He watched 
Eumaeus sling a sharp sword over his sturdy shoulders , wrap himself in his thick cloak against the wind , pick up the fleece of a well-fed full-grown goat , and a spear to drive off dogs and men , and go out to sleep where the white-tusked boars slept , under an overhanging rock , sheltered from northerly winds . /
