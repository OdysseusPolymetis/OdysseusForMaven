
Now , a common vagrant arrived at the palace , one who was used to begging his way through the Ithacan 
city , and known for his ravenous belly , eating , drinking but never satisfied . 
He was bulky to look at , but lacking in power and strength . Arnaeus was the name his mother had honoured him with at birth , but all the young men called him 
Irus , because he ran errands on demand . once he arrived he was all for driving 
Odysseus out of his palace , and began to abuse him with a flight of words : �Get away from the threshold , old man , before you have to be dragged away by the feet . See how they all give me the nod , telling me to haul you out ? 
Still , I�m ashamed to stoop to that . 
So , up with you , before we quarrel and come to blows . � / 
Then resourceful 
Odysseus glowered and answered him with a dark look : �God-crazed man , I�m not hurting you whatever I do or say . I don�t begrudge what they might give you , however big the portion . This step will hold us both . You�ve no need to be jealous of what others get , since you�re a beggar like me . We must look to the gods for any riches we obtain . but take care how you threaten me with your fists , lest you rouse my anger . 
Old though I am , I�d drench your mouth and chest with your blood . 
Then I�d have greater peace and quiet tomorrow . I doubt you�d return , a second time , to the halls of 
Odysseus , Laertes� son . � / 
Irus , the beggar , reacted 
angrily : �Well now ! 
How glibly the filthy swine chatters , like an old woman at her cooking . but I�ll make trouble for him , a right and left that�ll scatter his jaw full of teeth on the ground , like an old sow punished for eating the crop . Gird your loins , and let all these men see us fight : if you dare fight a younger man ? � / 
So , at the gleaming threshold in front of the high doorway they goaded each other mercilessly . 
And princely 
Antinous , hearing them both , burst out laughing , and called to the 
Suitors : �Friends , the gods have never brought us such sport as this . 
Irus and the stranger are rousing for a fight . 
Quickly let�s set them a prize . � / At this , they all leapt up grinning , and crowded round the ragged beggars . �Listen . � 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , proclaimed , �Listen to what I have to say . 
There are goats� paunches filled with blood and fat , there by the fire ready for roasting , waiting for our dinner . 
Now , whichever of the two proves the better man , and conquers , let him come and take his pick of them . 
And more , he shall always dine with us . 
And we�ll not let anyone else mingle among us and beg . � / 
They were all pleased at Antinous� words . 
Resourceful 
Odysseus then made a clever 
request : �Friends , there�s no way an old man weakened by suffering can take on a younger . 
Nevertheless this hungry belly of mine , always creating trouble , prompts me to try and last out his blows . 
So , come now , swear a binding oath , that none of you will side with 
Irus , heavy-handedly deal me a foul blow , and by violent means make me lose to this fellow . � / 
They all took the oath , as he requested , not to strike him , and when they had finished pledging their word , royal 
Telemachus spoke again : �Stranger , if your courage and noble spirit prompt you to defeat this man , have no fear of the 
Achaeans : whoever strikes you will have to deal with more than just you . I am your host , and the lords 
Antinous and 
Eurymachus , men of judgement , concur . � / 
They all praised his speech , so 
Odysseus 
girded his rags about his loins , baring his solid well-made thighs , showing his broad shoulders , and his muscular chest and arms . 
Athene herself drew close , and enhanced the limbs of the shepherd of his people . 
All the 
Suitors marvelled greatly , and with a glance at their neighbour they commented : �Irus will soon reap his own reward , and be un-Irused , given the thighs that old man shows under his rags . � / Irus� heart was shaken as they spoke , but the servants hitched up his clothes , and pushed him forward , the flesh on his limbs quivering with fear . 
So much so that 
Antinous abused him , shouting : �You 
Windbag ! It would be better if you were dead or had never been born , if you�re going to tremble like that , and be so afraid of this fellow , an old man with the weight of suffering on him . I�ll tell you straight . It will be like this . if he beats you and proves the better man , I�ll hurl you into a black ship�s hold , and pack you off to 
King 
Echetus over on the mainland . 
That maimer of men will trim your nose and ears with the pitiless bronze , and rip away your genitals too , and throw them raw to the scavenging dogs . � / At this Irus� limbs quivered all the more , as they prodded him into the ring , where both raised their fists . 
Then noble long-suffering 
Odysseus debated whether to strike him dead on the spot , or deal him a soft blow but still lay him flat on the ground . 
Throwing a softer punch seemed best , he thought , seeking to deceive the 
Achaeans . as they stood up to each other , 
Irus let fly at 
Odysseus� right shoulder , but Odysseus struck him on the neck under the ear , crushing the bone , so the blood ran red from his mouth , and he pitched in the dust with a groan , gnashing his teeth and flailing the ground with his feet . At this the noble 
Suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of laughter . 
Then 
Odysseus grabbed him by the foot , and dragged him out of the door , into the courtyard and up to the portico gates . 
There he propped him , sitting , upright against the wall with his stick in his hands , and spoke to him winged words : �Now sit there , you wretch , and scare off pigs and dogs , and stop lording it over strangers and beggars , lest you end in a worse plight . � 
So saying , he slung his wretched torn leather pouch over his shoulder by its twisted strap , returned to the threshold and sat down , while the 
Suitors went past , laughing loudly , and congratulating him : �Stranger , may 
Zeus and the other gods grant you your heart�s dearest wish , your fondest desire , since you�ve ended that greedy fellow�s begging here . We�ll soon pack him off to 
King 
Echetus , the maimer of men , over on the mainland . � / 
Odysseus was delighted at these words of good omen . 
Antinous now presented him with the large paunch swollen with blood and fat , and 
Amphinomus took two loaves from a basket and placed them before him , pledging him from a golden cup : �Health , old 
Stranger , and may good fortune be yours in future , despite your present sorrows� / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus replied : �Amphinomus , you seem to be a sensible man , as I have heard your father , 
Nisus of 
Dulichium , was too . I have heard him named as a wealthy man and a brave one . 
You are his son it seems , a man of quiet speech . 
So mark my words , listen to what I say . Of all the creatures that breathe and move on 
Earth , there is none as powerless as man . as long as the gods grant him success and strength he thinks he will never know future suffering . 
Yet when the blessed gods instead bring trouble on him , he must endure the pain with whatever patience he can . Men�s spirits on this 
Earth depend on the fate the 
Father of gods and men decrees . / I too once had a measure of prosperity among men , but I was seduced by strength and power to many wanton acts , relying on my father and my brothers to help me . let me be a lesson to men not to be lawless , but to enjoy the gifts of the gods in peace . 
Here I see the 
Suitors wantonly wasting the possessions and demeaning the wife of one who will not be away much longer from his friends and his native land . I tell you , he is near , and may some god prompt you homewards , so you need not face him on his return . 
He and the 
Suitors will not part without bloodshed , I think , once he is under his own roof . � / 
He spoke , and poured a libation , then drank the honeyed wine , and returned the cup to the young nobleman�s hands . but 
Amphinomus went back through the hall with a heavy heart , with his head bowed , foreseeing trouble . 
That did not save him from his fate . 
Athene had already bound him hand and foot , marking him for swift death from a spear at the hands of 
Telemachus . 
Now he sat down once more on the chair he had risen from . / 
Now the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , prompted wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , to show herself to the 
Suitors , so she might stir their hearts , and also enhance herself in her husband�s and son�s eyes . 
With a forced laugh she spoke to her housekeeper : �Eurynome , my heart prompts me to show myself to the 
Suitors , though it has never done so before , and though I detest them . Also I wish to speak to my son for his own good , and tell him not to mix endlessly with those arrogant men , who speak to him respectfully while plotting trouble . � / �Indeed , 
Child , � 
Eurynome replied , �what you say make sense . Go and speak to your son , be open with him . 
First wash yourself and smooth your cheeks , since it is wrong to weep endlessly without cease . as you know , your son is of age now and to see him bearded , and a man , was always your dearest prayer . � / �Eurynome , � said wise 
Penelope in answer , �Don�t tempt me , out of love for me , to wash my body and smooth my cheeks . 
The gods who rule Olympus robbed me of all the beauty that was mine the day when he left in the hollow ship . 
Yet tell 
Autonoe and 
Hippodameia to come and attend me in the hall . I will not appear before all those men alone : modesty forbids it . � / At this the old woman went off through the house to summon the maids . 
Meanwhile the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had another idea . 
She shed sweet sleep over 
Penelope , so that she leaned back , her limbs relaxed , and fell asleep on her couch . 
Then the lovely goddess endowed her with immortal gifts , so the 
Achaeans would wonder at her . 
First she cleansed her lovely face with beauty itself , ambrosial beauty such as 
Cythereia of the lovely crown anoints herself with when she joins with the Graces in their sweet dance . 
She made her taller and statelier too , and whiter of skin than new-cut ivory . as the lovely goddess left , the white-armed maids came from the hall , chattering together . 
Then 
Penelope woke from sleep , and smoothed her hands over her face , saying : �Oh , soft slumber wrapped me round despite my misery . if only chaste Artemis would grant me a death as gentle , and stop me wasting my life on heartfelt sorrow , longing for my dear husband and all his virtues that made him supreme among the 
Achaeans . � / 
With this she left the bright room upstairs , not alone but with her two maids . 
When the lovely lady neared the 
Suitors , she drew her shining veil across her face , and stood by a pillar of the great hall with a faithful maid on either side . 
The 
Suitors limbs trembled , their minds were intoxicated with desire , and every one of them prayed he might bed her . but she turned to her brave son 
Telemachus , saying : �Your ideas and judgement are not as sound as they were , 
Telemachus . 
Even as a child you showed more wisdom than now . 
Though mature and on the verge of manhood , so tall and handsome any stranger from abroad would judge you a rich man�s son , your ideas and judgement are not as they were . 
How can you let such a thing happen , a stranger abused in our house ! if a stranger , seated in our home , comes to harm through their violence , public shame and disgrace would fall on you . � / �Mother , � wise 
Telemachus answered , �I cannot blame you for being angered . I am aware of it all myself , and do know right from wrong . 
My childishness is of the past . but I cannot always plan as I wish , without help , troubled by these men who surround me with their evil thoughts . but the fight between 
Irus and the stranger , I tell you , did not go as the 
Suitors 
intended , and the stranger proved the better man . 
Father 
Zeus , 
Athene , 
Apollo , oh , how I wish the 
Suitors were beaten too , scattered around the courtyard and halls , limbs slack and heads lolling , like 
Irus who sits out there by the yard gate , head rolling like a drunkard , unable to get to his feet and find his way to wherever he lives with those slackened limbs . � / 
So they conversed , and 
Eurymachus spoke to 
Penelope , saying : �Wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , if all the 
Achaeans in 
Iasian 
Argos had sight of you , even more 
Suitors would feast in your halls tomorrow . in beauty , form and intellect you exceed all other women . � / �Eurymachus� , wise 
Penelope replied , �all my excellence of form and beauty the gods robbed me of that day when the 
Argives sailed for ilium , my husband 
Odysseus with them . if only he might return and cherish this life of mine , I might deserve a greater and more glorious fame . but so many are the troubles a god has heaped upon me , I only grieve . 
When he sailed away , forsaking his own land , did he not take me by the wrist of my right hand and say : �My wife I think not all the bronze-greaved 
Achaeans will get home safe and unharmed from 
Troy . 
They say the 
Trojans are true warriors , good with both spear and bow , charioteers whose swift horses soon tip the balance in the thick of a fight . 
So I cannot tell if the god will bring me home , or whether I�ll die on the plains of 
Troy . 
Therefore you must take charge here . look after my father and mother in the palace as at present , or more so as I am far away . but when my son reaches manhood , marry whoever you wish , and leave home . � / 
Now all is happening as he foresaw . a hateful wedding night will be my cursed fate , I whose happiness 
Zeus has destroyed . 
And in all of this , bitter trouble fills my heart and soul : 
Suitors like you have never been known before . Those who desire to wed a noble lady , a rich man�s daughter , compete to bring cattle and fine sheep to make a feast for the lady�s friends , and they give her splendid gifts . 
They do not consume another man�s wealth without payment . � / Those were her words , and noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was pleased , because she elicited gifts from them , deceiving them with subtle words while her mind was fixed elsewhere . / 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , it was who replied , saying : �Wise 
Penelope Icarius� daughter , accept the gifts we 
Achaeans may wish to bring you . It would be wrong to deny you gifts . as for us , we will not leave for home or elsewhere until you wed the best 
Achaean here . � / Antinous� speech pleased the rest , and they each sent a squire to fetch gifts . Antinous� squire presented a fine long richly-embroidered robe , pinned by a dozen golden brooches , with curved clasps . Eurymachus� squire brought a cleverly made golden chain , strung with amber beads that shone like the sun . 
His two squires brought 
Eurydamas a pair of earrings , each earring a triple cluster of mulberry-shaped drops , gracefully glowing . 
And from the house of lord 
Peisander , Polyctor�s son , his squire 
carried a necklace , an adornment of great beauty . 
So the 
Achaeans offered her gift after gift , and the lovely lady withdrew to her room above , her maids carrying the charming gifts for her . / 
Then till dusk the 
Suitors delighted themselves with dances and songs to stir the heart , and they were still enjoying themselves when darkness fell . 
Swiftly they set up three braziers in the hall to shed some light , and stacked dry kindling beside them , hard and seasoned and freshly split , and set up torches in the gaps between them , and enduring Odysseus� maidservants fed the fires . 
Then it was that resourceful 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , spoke to them , saying : �Servants of 
Odysseus , your long-absent master , go to the room of your beloved 
Queen , sit there and cheer her spirit , carding wool by her or spinning yarn . I will shed light on all these men . if they choose to lie in wait for 
Dawn of the lovely throne they�ll not outdo me . I am a man who can take a great deal . � / 
The maids laughed outright at his words , exchanging glances . 
Melantho of the lovely cheeks upbraided him mercilessly , 
Melantho , Dolius� child , whom 
Penelope had reared and loved as her own , giving her every plaything she desired . 
Nevertheless she had no sympathy for 
Penelope . 
Instead she slept with 
Eurymachus whom she loved . 
She it was who jeered at 
Odysseus , with shameful words : �You must be mad , you wretch , to stand here , talking shamelessly , in the company of great men , and not feel afraid , when you should be off to sleep in the smithy , or some other place where common people go . 
The wine must have addled your brain , 
Stranger , or else your mind is always like this , making you babble endless nonsense . have you got above yourself , because you thrashed that beggar 
Irus ? 
Take care that some better man than 
Irus doesn�t stand against you , thump your head with heavy fists , cover you in blood , and send you packing . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus glowered at her , and answered 
angrily : �I�ll be off soon , but only to 
Telemachus , to let him know what kind of words you bitches use , and then he�ll flay you to pieces where you stand . � / 
His words sent the women scattering through the hall , their limbs trembling in terror , believing he meant it . but 
Odysseus took up his stand by the burning braziers , to tend the lights while watching the 
Suitors . 
His mind was full of other plans that would not fail to come to fruition . / 
Athene , meanwhile , would not allow the arrogant 
Suitors to curb their bitter insults : that the pain might sink deeper to the heart of 
Odysseus , Laertes� son . 
Eurymachus , son of Polybus , began to taunt 
Odysseus , rousing his friends� laughter : / �Listen , you 
Suitors of the glorious 
Queen , let me speak as my heart prompts me . This man must come to Odysseus� palace as a gift of the gods : the torch glare shines from his head at any rate , since there�s never a trace of hair . � 
Then he called out to 
Odysseus , the sacker of cities : �Stranger , how would you like me to hire you . 
You could collect walling stone and plant tall trees on a remote farm of mine � all for a fixed wage ? I�d provide food all year too , and clothes and sandals . but I doubt you�d care for hard work , since you�ve learned bad ways . You�d rather skulk about , begging to feed your greedy belly . � / �Eurymachus , � resourceful 
Odysseus answered , �I wish the two of us could compete as reapers in the hayfields , in late spring when the days are longer , I with a curved scythe in my hand , you with the same , and a rich crop of grass to make us labour , without pause for food , till evening . or in a four-acre field with teams of oxen , big and tawny , the best there are , well-fed on grass and matched in age and strength under the yoke , powerful beasts , and loam nice and yielding under the plough . 
Then you�d see if I could cut a straight furrow�s length . or I wish 
Zeus , the son of 
Cronos , would start a war somewhere , for us , I with a shield and twin spears and a bronze helmet clapped on my head . 
Then you�d find me in the front rank , and you�d not make speeches about this belly of mine . but you�re arrogant at heart and mean-spirited , thinking you�re a great and powerful man because you mingle with a few weaklings . ah , if 
Odysseus came back to his own land , those doors , wide though they are , would prove all too narrow for you as you fled the threshold . � / At this , 
Eurymachus flared up even more , and with a lowering glance , spoke winged words at him : �I�ll soon punish you , you wretch , for talking shamelessly , in the company of great men , and not even looking scared . 
The wine must have addled your brain , 
Stranger , or else your mind is always like this , making you babble endless nonsense . have you got above yourself , because you thrashed that beggar 
Irus ? � / 
With this he grabbed a stool , but 
Odysseus , fearing attack , squatted at the knees of 
Amphinomus of 
Dulichium , and Eurymachus� missile struck a cup-bearer on the right hand , so that his wine jug fell to the floor with a clang , and he fell back in the dust . 
The shadowy halls broke out in uproar , and the 
Suitors looked at each other , saying : �Better this stranger had died elsewhere on his travels , before he got to us , then we would have been spared all this annoyance . 
Here we are , fighting over beggars , and the pleasure of our rich feast will be spoiled by all this trouble . � / 
Now royal 
Telemachus called out : �Sirs , you are touched by the gods with madness , and show the extent of your drinking : surely a god has stirred you . 
You have dined well , so go to your homes and rest : as the spirit takes you , since I�ll drive no one away . � / 
They could only bite their lips at this , and wonder at Telemachus� boldness . 
Then 
Amphinomus , son of noble 
Nisus , Aretias� son , addressed them : �Friends , anger and carping words are a poor answer to a fair speech . No more abuse of the 
Stranger , or any of the servants of noble Odysseus� house . 
Come , let the steward fill each man�s cup so we can pour a libation , then go home and rest . as for the 
Stranger , leave him to Telemachus� care in Odysseus� hall , since it is to his house he came . � / 
His words pleased them all , and noble 
Mulius , Amphinomus� squire , of 
Dulichium , mixed wine in a bowl , and served each man in turn . 
They poured libations to the blessed gods , and drank the honeyed wine , and when they had all made their offering , and drunk to their heart�s content , they went off , each to his own house , to take their rest . / 
Now , a common vagrant arrived at the palace , one who was used to begging his way through the Ithacan 
city , and known for his ravenous belly , eating , drinking but never satisfied . 
He was bulky to look at , but lacking in power and strength . Arnaeus was the name his mother had honoured him with at birth , but all the young men called him 
Irus , because he ran errands on demand . once he arrived he was all for driving 
Odysseus out of his palace , and began to abuse him with a flight of words : �Get away from the threshold , old man , before you have to be dragged away by the feet . See how they all give me the nod , telling me to haul you out ? 
Still , I�m ashamed to stoop to that . 
So , up with you , before we quarrel and come to blows . � / 
Then resourceful 
Odysseus glowered and answered him with a dark look : �God-crazed man , I�m not hurting you whatever I do or say . I don�t begrudge what they might give you , however big the portion . This step will hold us both . You�ve no need to be jealous of what others get , since you�re a beggar like me . We must look to the gods for any riches we obtain . but take care how you threaten me with your fists , lest you rouse my anger . 
Old though I am , I�d drench your mouth and chest with your blood . 
Then I�d have greater peace and quiet tomorrow . I doubt you�d return , a second time , to the halls of 
Odysseus , Laertes� son . � / 
Irus , the beggar , reacted 
angrily : �Well now ! 
How glibly the filthy swine chatters , like an old woman at her cooking . but I�ll make trouble for him , a right and left that�ll scatter his jaw full of teeth on the ground , like an old sow punished for eating the crop .

Antinous , hearing them both , burst out laughing , and called to the 
Suitors : �Friends , the gods have never brought us such sport as this .

There are goats� paunches filled with blood and fat , there by the fire ready for roasting , waiting for our dinner . 
Now , whichever of the two proves the better man , and conquers , let him come and take his pick of them . 
And more , he shall always dine with us . 
And we�ll not let anyone else mingle among us and beg . � / 
They were all pleased at Antinous� words .

Odysseus then made a clever

Hippodameia to come and attend me in the hall . I will not appear before all those men alone : modesty forbids it . � / At this the old woman went off through the house to summon the maids . 
Meanwhile the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had another idea . 
She shed sweet sleep over 
Penelope , so that she leaned back , her limbs relaxed , and fell asleep on her couch . 
Then the lovely goddess endowed her with immortal gifts , so the 
Achaeans would wonder at her . 
First she cleansed her lovely face with beauty itself , ambrosial beauty such as 
Cythereia of the lovely crown anoints herself with when she joins with the Graces in their sweet dance . 
She made her taller and statelier too , and whiter of skin than new-cut ivory . as the lovely goddess left , the white-armed maids came from the hall , chattering together . 
Then 
Penelope woke from sleep , and smoothed her hands over her face , saying : �Oh , soft slumber wrapped me round despite my misery . if only chaste Artemis would grant me a death as gentle , and stop me wasting my life on heartfelt sorrow , longing for my dear husband and all his virtues that made him supreme among the 
Achaeans . � / 
With this she left the bright room upstairs , not alone but with her two maids . 
When the lovely lady neared the 
Suitors , she drew her shining veil across her face , and stood by a pillar of the great hall with a faithful maid on either side . 
The 
Suitors limbs trembled , their minds were intoxicated with desire , and every one of them prayed he might bed her . but she turned to her brave son 
Telemachus , saying : �Your ideas and judgement are not as sound as they were , 
Telemachus . 
Even as a child you showed more wisdom than now . 
Though mature and on the verge of manhood , so tall and handsome any stranger from abroad would judge you a rich man�s son , your ideas and judgement are not as they were . 
How can you let such a thing happen , a stranger abused in our house ! if a stranger , seated in our home , comes to harm through their violence , public shame and disgrace would fall on you . � / �Mother , � wise 
Telemachus answered , �I cannot blame you for being angered . I am aware of it all myself , and do know right from wrong . 
My childishness is of the past . but I cannot always plan as I wish , without help , troubled by these men who surround me with their evil thoughts . but the fight between 
Irus and the stranger , I tell you , did not go as the 
Suitors 
intended , and the stranger proved the better man . 
Father 
Zeus , 
Athene , 
Apollo , oh , how I wish the 
Suitors were beaten too , scattered around the courtyard and halls , limbs slack and heads lolling , like 
Irus who sits out there by the yard gate , head rolling like a drunkard , unable to get to his feet and find his way to wherever he lives with those slackened limbs . � / 
So they conversed , and 
Eurymachus spoke to 
Penelope , saying : �Wise 
Penelope , Icarius� daughter , if all the 
Achaeans in 
Iasian 
Argos had sight of you , even more 
Suitors would feast in your halls tomorrow . in beauty , form and intellect you exceed all other women . � / �Eurymachus� , wise 
Penelope replied , �all my excellence of form and beauty the gods robbed me of that day when the 
Argives sailed for ilium , my husband 
Odysseus with them . if only he might return and cherish this life of mine , I might deserve a greater and more glorious fame . but so many are the troubles a god has heaped upon me , I only grieve . 
When he sailed away , forsaking his own land , did he not take me by the wrist of my right hand and say : �My wife I think not all the bronze-greaved 
Achaeans will get home safe and unharmed from 
Troy . 
They say the 
Trojans are true warriors , good with both spear and bow , charioteers whose swift horses soon tip the balance in the thick of a fight . 
So I cannot tell if the god will bring me home , or whether I�ll die on the plains of 
Troy . 
Therefore you must take charge here . look after my father and mother in the palace as at present , or more so as I am far away . but when my son reaches manhood , marry whoever you wish , and leave home . � / 
Now all is happening as he foresaw . a hateful wedding night will be my cursed fate , I whose happiness 
Zeus has destroyed . 
And in all of this , bitter trouble fills my heart and soul : 
Suitors like you have never been known before . Those who desire to wed a noble lady , a rich man�s daughter , compete to bring cattle and fine sheep to make a feast for the lady�s friends , and they give her splendid gifts . 
They do not consume another man�s wealth without payment . � / Those were her words , and noble long-suffering 
Odysseus was pleased , because she elicited gifts from them , deceiving them with subtle words while her mind was fixed elsewhere . / 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , it was who replied , saying : �Wise 
Penelope Icarius� daughter , accept the gifts we 
Achaeans may wish to bring you . It would be wrong to deny you gifts . as for us , we will not leave for home or elsewhere until you wed the best 
Achaean here . � / Antinous� speech pleased the rest , and they each sent a squire to fetch gifts . Antinous� squire presented a fine long richly-embroidered robe , pinned by a dozen golden brooches , with curved clasps . Eurymachus� squire brought a cleverly made golden chain , strung with amber beads that shone like the sun . 
His two squires brought 
Eurydamas a pair of earrings , each earring a triple cluster of mulberry-shaped drops , gracefully glowing . 
And from the house of lord 
Peisander , Polyctor�s son , his squire 
carried a necklace , an adornment of great beauty . 
So the 
Achaeans offered her gift after gift , and the lovely lady withdrew to her room above , her maids carrying the charming gifts for her . / 
Then till dusk the 
Suitors delighted themselves with dances and songs to stir the heart , and they were still enjoying themselves when darkness fell . 
Swiftly they set up three braziers in the hall to shed some light , and stacked dry kindling beside them , hard and seasoned and freshly split , and set up torches in the gaps between them , and enduring Odysseus� maidservants fed the fires . 
Then it was that resourceful 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , spoke to them , saying : �Servants of 
Odysseus , your long-absent master , go to the room of your beloved 
Queen , sit there and cheer her spirit , carding wool by her or spinning yarn . I will shed light on all these men . if they choose to lie in wait for 
Dawn of the lovely throne they�ll not outdo me . I am a man who can take a great deal . � / 
The maids laughed outright at his words , exchanging glances . 
Melantho of the lovely cheeks upbraided him mercilessly , 
Melantho , Dolius� child , whom 
Penelope had reared and loved as her own , giving her every plaything she desired . 
Nevertheless she had no sympathy for 
Penelope . 
Instead she slept with 
Eurymachus whom she loved . 
She it was who jeered at 
Odysseus , with shameful words : �You must be mad , you wretch , to stand here , talking shamelessly , in the company of great men , and not feel afraid , when you should be off to sleep in the smithy , or some other place where common people go . 
The wine must have addled your brain , 
Stranger , or else your mind is always like this , making you babble endless nonsense . have you got above yourself , because you thrashed that beggar 
Irus ? 
Take care that some better man than 
Irus doesn�t stand against you , thump your head with heavy fists , cover you in blood , and send you packing . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus glowered at her , and answered 
angrily : �I�ll be off soon , but only to 
Telemachus , to let him know what kind of words you bitches use , and then he�ll flay you to pieces where you stand . � / 
His words sent the women scattering through the hall , their limbs trembling in terror , believing he meant it . but 
Odysseus took up his stand by the burning braziers , to tend the lights while watching the 
Suitors . 
His mind was full of other plans that would not fail to come to fruition . / 
Athene , meanwhile , would not allow the arrogant 
Suitors to curb their bitter insults : that the pain might sink deeper to the heart of 
Odysseus , Laertes� son . 
Eurymachus , son of Polybus , began to taunt 
Odysseus , rousing his friends� laughter : / �Listen , you 
Suitors of the glorious 
Queen , let me speak as my heart prompts me . This man must come to Odysseus� palace as a gift of the gods : the torch glare shines from his head at any rate , since there�s never a trace of hair . � 
Then he called out to 
Odysseus , the sacker of cities : �Stranger , how would you like me to hire you . 
You could collect walling stone and plant tall trees on a remote farm of mine � all for a fixed wage ? I�d provide food all year too , and clothes and sandals . but I doubt you�d care for hard work , since you�ve learned bad ways . You�d rather skulk about , begging to feed your greedy belly . � / �Eurymachus , � resourceful 
Odysseus answered , �I wish the two of us could compete as reapers in the hayfields , in late spring when the days are longer , I with a curved scythe in my hand , you with the same , and a rich crop of grass to make us labour , without pause for food , till evening . or in a four-acre field with teams of oxen , big and tawny , the best there are , well-fed on grass and matched in age and strength under the yoke , powerful beasts , and loam nice and yielding under the plough . 
Then you�d see if I could cut a straight furrow�s length . or I wish 
Zeus , the son of 
Cronos , would start a war somewhere , for us , I with a shield and twin spears and a bronze helmet clapped on my head . 
Then you�d find me in the front rank , and you�d not make speeches about this belly of mine . but you�re arrogant at heart and mean-spirited , thinking you�re a great and powerful man because you mingle with a few weaklings . ah , if 
Odysseus came back to his own land , those doors , wide though they are , would prove all too narrow for you as you fled the threshold . � / At this , 
Eurymachus flared up even more , and with a lowering glance , spoke winged words at him : �I�ll soon punish you , you wretch , for talking shamelessly , in the company of great men , and not even looking scared . 
The wine must have addled your brain , 
Stranger , or else your mind is always like this , making you babble endless nonsense . have you got above yourself , because you thrashed that beggar 
Irus ? � / 
With this he grabbed a stool , but 
Odysseus , fearing attack , squatted at the knees of 
Amphinomus of 
Dulichium , and Eurymachus� missile struck a cup-bearer on the right hand , so that his wine jug fell to the floor with a clang , and he fell back in the dust . 
The shadowy halls broke out in uproar , and the 
Suitors looked at each other , saying : �Better this stranger had died elsewhere on his travels , before he got to us , then we would have been spared all this annoyance . 
Here we are , fighting over beggars , and the pleasure of our rich feast will be spoiled by all this trouble . � / 
Now royal 
Telemachus called out : �Sirs , you are touched by the gods with madness , and show the extent of your drinking : surely a god has stirred you . 
You have dined well , so go to your homes and rest : as the spirit takes you , since I�ll drive no one away . � / 
They could only bite their lips at this , and wonder at Telemachus� boldness . 
Then 
Amphinomus , son of noble 
Nisus , Aretias� son , addressed them : �Friends , anger and carping words are a poor answer to a fair speech . No more abuse of the 
Stranger , or any of the servants of noble Odysseus� house . 
Come , let the steward fill each man�s cup so we can pour a libation , then go home and rest . as for the 
Stranger , leave him to Telemachus� care in Odysseus� hall , since it is to his house he came . � / 
His words pleased them all , and noble 
Mulius , Amphinomus� squire , of 
Dulichium , mixed wine in a bowl , and served each man in turn . 
They poured libations to the blessed gods , and drank the honeyed wine , and when they had all made their offering , and drunk to their heart�s content , they went off , each to his own house , to take their rest . /
