
Now 
Dawn rose from her bed beside renowned 
Tithonus , bringing light to the deathless ones and to mortal men . 
The gods were seated in council , 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , greatest of all , among them . 
Athene was speaking of Odysseus� many sufferings , recalling them to their minds , unhappy that he was still a prisoner in Calypso�s isle : / �Father 
Zeus , and all you blessed ever-living gods , may sceptered kings never be kind or gentle , or think of justice , from this time on : let them be arbitrary and cruel , since not one of the race that divine 
Odysseus ruled remembers him , though he was tender as a father . 
He suffers misery in the island home of the nymph 
Calypso , who keeps him captive there . 
He cannot head for home without oared ship or crew to carry him over the sea�s wide back : and men plot to murder his beloved son who is journeying home from sacred 
Pylos and noble 
Sparta , where he went seeking news of his father . � / 
Cloud-Gathering 
Zeus replied : �My child , what words escape your lips ? 
Was this not of your own devising , that 
Odysseus might 
return and take vengeance on them all ? as for Telemachus , direct him wisely , since you have the power , so that he may reach home safely , while the 
Suitors 
return , their purpose thwarted . � / 
Then he instructed 
Hermes , his faithful son : �Since you are ever our messenger , 
Hermes , tell the nymph of the lovely tresses of our resolve , that enduring 
Odysseus shall 
return without help of gods or mortal men , but with great suffering he shall come , on a close-knit raft , on the twentieth day , to Scheria�s rich soil , the land of the 
Phaeacians , kin to the gods . 
They will honour him from the heart , as if he were divine , and send him on board ship to his native land , gifting him piles of gold , and bronze and garments , more than he could ever have won from 
Troy if he had reached home safely with his fair share of the spoils . 
This is the way he is fated to see his people again , his vaulted palace , and native isle . � / 
He spoke , and the messenger god , the slayer of argus , promptly obeyed . 
He quickly fastened to his feet the lovely imperishable golden sandals that carry him swift as the flowing wind over the ocean waves and the boundless earth . 
He took up the wand as well , with which he lulls men to sleep , or wakes them from slumber , and the mighty slayer of argus flew off with it in his hand . 
He 
stepped out of the ether onto the 
Pierian coast then swooped over the sea , skimming the waves like a cormorant that drenches its dense plumage with brine , as it searches for fish in the fearsome gulfs of the restless ocean . 
So 
Hermes travelled over the endless breakers , until he reached the distant isle , then leaving the violet sea he crossed the land , and came to the vast cave where the nymph of the lovely tresses lived , and found her at home . / a great fire blazed on the hearth , and the scent of burning cedar logs and juniper spread far across the isle . Sweet-voiced 
Calypso was singing within , moving to and fro at her loom , weaving with a golden shuttle . 
Around the cave grew a thick copse of alder , poplar and fragrant cypress , where large birds nested , owls , and falcons , and long-necked cormorants whose business is with the sea . 
And heavy with clustered grapes a mature cultivated vine went trailing across the hollow entrance . 
And four neighbouring springs , channelled this way and that , flowed with crystal water , and all around in soft meadows iris and wild celery flourished . 
Even an immortal passing by might pause and marvel , delighted in spirit , and the messenger-god , the slayer of argus , stood there and wondered . but when he had marvelled at all he saw , he quickly entered the wide-cave-mouth , and 
Calypso , the lovely goddess knew him when she saw his face , since the deathless gods are not unknown to each other , however far apart they live . Of 
Odysseus there was no sign , since he sat wretched as ever on the shore , troubling his heart with tears and sighs and grief . 
There he could gaze out over the rolling waves , with streaming eyes . / 
When the lovely goddess , 
Calypso , had seated 
Hermes on a bright gleaming chair , she questioned him : �Why are you here , 
Hermes of the golden wand , an honoured and welcome guest ? 
You rarely visit me . Speak whatever is in your mind : my heart says do it , if do it I can , and if it can be done . but follow me 
now , so I can offer you refreshment . � / 
With this the goddess set ambrosia on a table in front of him , and mixed a bowl of red nectar . 
So the messenger-god , the slayer of argus , ate and drank , and when he had dined to his heart�s content , he replied to her question : �Goddess to god , you ask why I am here , and since you ask I will tell you clearly . 
Zeus it was who sent me , unwillingly . 
Who would choose to fly over the vast space of the briny sea , unspeakably vast ? 
And no cities about : no mortals to sacrifice to the gods , and make choice offerings . but no god can escape or deny the will of 
Zeus , the aegis bearer . 
He says that you have here a man , the most unfortunate of all those warriors who fought nine years round Priam�s 
city , and sacked it in the tenth , then left for home . Setting out , having 
offended 
Athene , she raised a violent storm and towering seas . 
All the rest of his noble friends were drowned , but the wind and the waves that carried him brought him here . 
Zeus commands you to send him swiftly on his way : it is not his fate to die here far from his friends : he is destined to see those friends again , and reach his vaulted house and his native isle . � / At this , the lovely goddess , 
Calypso , shuddered , and spoke to him winged words : �You are cruel , you gods , and quickest to envy , since you are jealous if any goddess openly mates with a man , taking a mortal to her bed . 
Jealous , you gods , who live untroubled , of rosy-fingered 
Dawn and her 
Orion , till virgin 
Artemis , of the golden throne , attacked him with painless arrows in 
Ortygia , and slew him . 
Jealous , when 
Demeter of the lovely tresses , gave way to passion and lay with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed field . 
Zeus soon heard of it , and struck him dead with his bright bolt of lightning . 
And jealous 
now of me , you gods , because I befriend a man , one I saved as he straddled the keel alone , when 
Zeus had blasted and shattered his swift ship with a bright lightning bolt , out on the wine-dark sea . 
There all his noble friends were lost , but the wind and waves carried him here . I welcomed him generously and fed him , and promised to make him immortal and un-aging . but since no god can escape or deny the will of 
Zeus the aegis bearer , let him go , if 
Zeus so orders and commands it , let him sail the restless sea . but I will not convey him , having no oared ship , and no crew , to send him off over the wide sea�s back . 
Yet I�ll cheerfully advise him , and openly , so he may get back safe to his native land . � / �Then send him off 
now , as you suggest� , said the messenger god , the slayer of argus , �and be wary of Zeus� anger , lest he is provoked and visits that anger on you some day . � / 
With this the mighty slayer of argus departed , and the lovely 
Nymph , mindful of Zeus� command , looked for valiant 
Odysseus . 
She found him sitting on the shore , his eyes as ever wet with tears , life�s sweetness ebbing from him in longing for his home , since the 
Nymph no longer pleased him . 
He was forced to sleep with her in the hollow cave at night , as she wished though he did not , but by day he sat among rocks or sand , tormenting himself with tears , groans and anguish , gazing with wet eyes at the restless sea . / 
The lovely goddess spoke as she approached him : �Be sad no longer , unhappy man , don�t waste your life in pining : I am ready and willing to send you on your way . 
Fell tall trees with the axe , make a substantial raft , and fasten planks across for decking , so it can carry you over the misty sea . 
And I will stock it with bread and water , and red wine to your heart�s content , to stave off hunger and thirst , and I�ll give you clothing too . 
And I�ll raise a following wind , so you reach home safely , if that is the will of the gods who rule the wide heavens , since they have more power than I to fulfil their purpose . � / At this noble enduring 
Odysseus shuddered , and he spoke to her winged words : �Goddess , you must mean something other , suggesting I cross the dangerous , daunting sea�s vast gulf on a raft , where not even the fine swift sailing ships go , enjoying the winds of 
Zeus . I will not trust myself to a raft when you do not wish it , unless you , goddess , give me your solemn word that you are not planning something new to harm me . � / 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , smiled at his words and , stroking his arm , replied : �What a rascal you are , with a devious mind , to think of speaking so to me ? 
So let 
Earth be my witness 
now , and the underground waters of 
Styx , this the blessed gods� greatest most dreadful oath , that I will not plan anything new to harm you . Rather my thoughts and advice are like those I would have for myself if I needed them . 
My intentions are honest ones , and my heart is not made of iron . 
It too can feel pity . � / 
With this , the lovely goddess swiftly walked away , and he followed in her footsteps . man and goddess reached the hollow cave , and he sat down on the chair that 
Hermes had used . 
Then the 
Nymph set all kinds of food and drink before him , those that mortals consume . but before her the maids set ambrosia and nectar , as she sat facing divine 
Odysseus . 
So they reached for the good things prepared for them . 
And when they had finished eating and drinking , 
Calypso , that lovely goddess , spoke first : �Son of 
Laertes , scion of 
Zeus , 
Odysseus of many resources , must you leave , like this , so soon ? 
Still , let fortune go with you . 
Though if your heart knew the depths of anguish you are fated to suffer before you reach home , you would stay and make your home with me , and be immortal , no matter how much you long to see that wife you yearn for day after day . I am surely no less than her , I contend , in height or form , since no woman can reasonably compete with the gods in form or face . � / 
Then resourceful 
Odysseus replied to her : �Great goddess , do not be angry at what I say . I know myself that wise 
Penelope is less than you , it�s true , in looks and stature , being a mortal , while you are immortal and ever young . 
Even so I yearn day after day , longing to reach home , and see the hour of my 
return . 
And if some god should strike me , out on the wine-dark sea , I will endure it , owning a heart within inured to suffering . for I have suffered much , and laboured much , in war and on the seas : add this then to the sum . � / as he spoke the sun dipped , and darkness fell . 
And the two of them found the deepest recess of the hollow cave , and delighted together in their lovemaking . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
Odysseus dressed in tunic and cloak , and the 
Nymph clothed herself in a long white robe , lovely and closely woven , and fastened a fine gold belt around her waist , and covered her head with a veil . 
Then she began to prepare valiant Odysseus� departure . 
She gave him a bronze double axe that fitted his hands well , one with its blades both sharpened , its fine olivewood handle firmly fixed , and a polished adze as well . 
She led the way to the fringes of the island where stands of alder , poplar , and fir rose to the sky : dry , well-seasoned timber that would ride high in the water . 
When she had shown him where the tall trees stood , 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , turned for home , while he began felling timber , making rapid progress . 
He cut down twenty trees in total , trimming them with the axe : then he smoothed them dextrously , and made their edges true . 
Meanwhile 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , brought him drills , and he bored through the timbers then joined them , hammering the mortice and tenon joints together . 
Odysseus made his raft as wide as a skilled shipwright makes the hull of a broad-beamed trading vessel . 
And he placed the decking , bolting the planks to the close-set timbers as he worked , completing the raft with long gunwales . 
He fixed up a mast and yardarm , and a steering oar for a rudder . 
Then he lined its sides from stem to stern with intertwined willows , as a defence against the sea , and covered the deck with brushwood . 
Meanwhile 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , had brought him the cloth for a sail , and he skilfully fashioned that too . 
Then he lashed the braces , halyards and sheets in place , and levered it down to the shining sea . / by the fourth day all his work was done , and on the fifth lovely 
Calypso bathed him and dressed him in scented clothes , and watched him set out . 
The goddess had placed a skin filled with dark wine on board , and a larger one of water , and a bag of provisions , full of many good things to content his heart , and she sent a fine breeze , warm and gentle . 
Odysseus spread his sail to the wind with joy , and steered the raft cleverly with the oar as he sat there . At night he never closed his eyes in sleep , but watched the Pleiades , late-setting 
Bootes , and the 
Great 
Bear that men call the 
Wain , that circles in place opposite 
Orion , and never bathes in the sea . 
Calypso , the lovely goddess had told him to keep that constellation to larboard as he crossed the waters . Seventeen days he sailed the seas , and on the eighteenth the shadowy peaks of the 
Phaeacian country loomed up ahead , like a shield on the misty sea . / but 
now lord 
Poseidon , the 
Earth-Shaker , returning from visiting 
Ethiopia , saw him far off from the 
Solymi range , as he came in sight over the water : and the god , angered in spirit , shook his head , and said to himself : �Well 
now , while I was among the 
Ethiopians , the gods have certainly changed their minds about 
Odysseus ! 
Here he is , close to 
Phaeacian country , where he�s fated to escape his trials and tribulations . but I�ll give him his fill of trouble yet . � / 
With that , he gathered the cloud , and seizing his trident in his hands , stirred up the sea , and roused the tempest blast of every wind , and hid the land and sea with vapour : and darkness swooped from the sky . 
The 
East 
Wind and 
South 
Wind clashed together , and the stormy 
West 
Wind , and the heaven-born 
North 
Wind , 
driving a vast wave before him . 
Then Odysseus� knee-joints slackened and his heart melted , and deeply shaken he communed with his own valiant spirit : �Oh , wretch that I am , what will become of me ? I fear the goddess spoke true when she said I would k
now full measure of suffering at sea before I reached my own country : now all is coming to pass . 
Zeus has covered the wide heavens with cloud , and troubled the sea , and the tempest blast of every wind sweeps over me : 
now I am doomed for sure . Thrice blessed , four times blessed those 
Danaans who died long ago on Troy�s wide plain working the will of the sons of 
Atreus . I wish I had met my fate like them , and died on that day when the 
Trojan host hurled their bronze-tipped spears at me while we fought for the corpse of 
Achilles , son of Peleus . 
Then I would have had proper burial , and the 
Achaeans would have trumpeted my fame , but 
now I am destined to die a miserable death . � / 
Even as he thought this , a great wave , sweeping down with terrible power , crashed over him , and whirled his raft around . 
Loosing the steering oar , he was thrown far from the raft , while a savage blast of tempestuous wind snapped the mast in two , and yardarm and sail fell far off in the sea . long the wave held him under , for the clothes 
Calypso gave him weighed him down , and he could not surface from under the great wave�s flow . At last he rose , and spat out bitter brine that ran too in streams from his hair . 
Labouring as he was , he still remembered the raft , lunged after it through the breakers , holding tight clambered to its centre , and sat there , trying to escape a deadly fate : and the heavy seas carried the raft to and fro in their path . 
Just as in autumn the 
North 
Wind blows a ball of thistle tufts , clinging together , over the fields , so the winds drove the raft to and fro over the sea . 
Now the 
South 
Wind flung it to the 
North 
Wind to be played with , then the 
East 
Wind gave it to the 
West 
Wind in play . / but 
Leucothea , the 
White 
Goddess , saw him , she who once had mortal speech as 
Ino of the slender ankles , Cadmus� daughter , but 
now in the deep is honoured by the gods . 
She 
pitied 
Odysseus , driven on , surrounded by dangers , and she rose from the waves like a sea mew on the wing , settled on the close-knit raft , and spoke to him : / �Poor wretch , why has 
Poseidon , the 
Earth-Shaker , dealt you such fierce suffering , sowing the seed of endless misery for you ? 
Yet for all his anger he shall not destroy you quite . 
You seem a man of sense , so do as I tell you . strip off these clothes , and let the wind take your raft , while you swim hard towards the 
Phaeacian coast , where you are destined to escape the waves . 
And take this veil , and wind it round your waist . 
It has divine power , and you need not fear injury or death . but when you clasp the land , unwind it once more , and cast it far out onto the wine-dark sea , and turn your eyes away . � / 
With this , the goddess gave him the veil , and like a sea mew dived at the stormy sea , and the dark wave covered her . 
Then long-suffering noble 
Odysseus thought long and hard , and , deeply shaken , communed with his valiant spirit : �Oh , let this not be one of the deathless ones , weaving a net for me , telling me to abandon the raft . I will not obey her yet , since the land , she said I would escape to , was far away when I saw it . 
This I shall do , and this seems best , to wait here as long as the timbers hold , and endure in misery , then if the seas beat the raft to pieces , swim , for want of a better plan . � / 
While he reflected in mind and heart , 
Poseidon , 
Earth-Shaker , raised another fearsome , threatening wave , arched above 
Odysseus , then hurled it down on him . 
Like a strong wind catching a pile of dry straw , scattering the stalks here and there , so the breaker scattered the raft�s timbers . but 
Odysseus straddled a plank , like a horseman , and stripped off the clothes lovely 
Calypso had given him . 
Then he wound the veil round his waist , and arms outstretched plunged into the sea , prepared to swim . lord 
Poseidon saw him , and shook his head , saying to himself : �Well then , after all that , you can drift through the sea till you come to men favoured by 
Zeus . 
Still I don�t think you�ll find it easy . � 
And with that he lashed his horses , with beautiful manes , and headed for his glorious palace at 
Aegae . / but 
Athene , daughter of 
Zeus , had an idea . 
She checked the winds in their course , and ordered them all to stop , and sink to rest , except for the swift 
North 
Wind , and him she commanded to smooth the waves ahead of the swimmer , so that 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , might escape from fate and death , and reach the 
Phaeacians , who love the oar . / 
Two nights and days he was tossed about on the swollen sea , and many a time he thought himself doomed . but when 
Dawn of the lovely tresses gave birth to the third day , the wind dropped , and there was breathless calm . 
Glancing ahead as a long breaker suddenly lifted him , he glimpsed the shore nearby . 
Just as a father�s recovery is welcome to his children when , to their joy , the gods free him from sickness , from the grip of some evil force that caused great pain , and long wasted him , so the wooded shore was welcome to 
Odysseus . 
He swam on , eager to reach solid ground . but , within shouting distance of the land , he heard the thunder of surf on rock , as powerful waves battered the coast , veiling the sea with spray . 
There was no safe harbour , no roadstead for ships to ride in , only jutting reefs and rocky cliffs and headlands . 
Then Odysseus� knee-joints slackened and his heart melted , and deeply shaken he communed with his valiant spirit : / �Oh , 
now 
Zeus has allowed me to reach land , beyond all expectation , and I have managed to carve my way across the deep , there seems no way to escape the grey waters . offshore are pointed reefs that the waves roar over , foaming : the rock is sheer , and the water deep close in , so a man can�t find his footing and escape from danger . if I try to get ashore a breaker may catch me , and dash me against the jagged rocks , and my labours will be in vain . if I swim on in hope of finding a shelving beach and a natural harbour , I fear a squall may strike again and carry me groaning out to sea , into the teeming deep , or some god may raise a monster from the void , like those herds great 
Amphitrite breeds . I know the 
Earth-Shaker means me harm . � / as he considered all this in heart and mind , a large wave drove him towards the splintered shore . 
There his skin would have been stripped , and his bones shattered , if the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had not given him an idea . Rushing by he clung to a rock with both hands , and hung there , groaning , till the wave had passed . 
So he survived , but with its backflow the wave caught him again , and took him , and drove him far out to sea . 
Just as pebbles stick to an octopus� suckers when it is dragged from its crevice , so pieces of skin stripped from his sturdy hands stuck to the rock , and the wave swallowed him . 
Then wretched 
Odysseus would surely have come to a premature end , if bright-eyed 
Athene had not sharpened his wits . 
Freeing himself from the surge breaking on shore , he swam outside it , staring towards the land , hoping to find a shelving beach or a natural harbour . 
Then , swimming , he came to the mouth of a swift-running river that seemed a good place , free of stones , and sheltered from the wind . 
He felt the current flowing , and prayed to the river god : / �Hear me , lord , whoever you might be . I come to you , as to one who is greatly longed for , as I try to escape the sea and Poseidon�s menace . 
Even to the eyes of the deathless gods that man is sacred who comes as a wanderer , as I come to your stream , to your knees , after many trials . 
Pity me , lord , I am your suppliant . � / as he ended , the god stemmed the current , held back the waves , and smoothed the water ahead , so bringing him safely to the river mouth . His knees gave way , and his arms fell slack , his strength exhausted by the sea . 
All his flesh was swollen , and streams of brine oozed from his mouth and nostrils . 
So he lay there , breathless , speechless , with barely energy enough to stir . but as he revived his spirits rose , and he unwound the goddess�s veil and dropped it into the ocean-bound flow : the current sweeping it downstream , so it was soon in Ino�s hands . 
Odysseus turned from the river , sank into the reeds and kissed the earth , giver of crops : and deeply shaken he communed with his valiant spirit : / �Oh , what will become of me ? 
What is my fate ? if I lie awake in the riverbed here , through the weary night , I fear the bitter cold and the dewfall may conquer my labouring heart , weak as it is , and river breezes blow chill at dawn . but if I climb the slope to the shadowy wood , and lie down in a dense thicket , hoping to lessen the cold and fatigue , and fall softly asleep , I fear to become the prey of wild beasts . � / 
Still as he thought about it , the latter seemed best : he headed for the wood , and found a place near the water by a clearing : there he crept under a pair of bushes , a thorn and an olive , growing from the same spot . 
They grew so closely twined together that the force of the damp breeze , and the bright sunlight , and the 
driving rain failed to penetrate . Under these 
Odysseus crept . 
He quickly made a wide bed with his hands from the heaps of fallen leaves , enough there to cover two or three men from the bitterest winter weather . 
Gazing at it , long-suffering 
Odysseus was relieved , and lay down in the centre , and covered himself with the fallen leaves . as a farmer on a lonely farm buries a glowing log under the blackened embers , to preserve a spark of fire , so that he need not light it again from somewhere else , so 
Odysseus buried himself in the leaves . 
And 
Athene poured sleep into his eyes , so as to close his eyelids , and free him quickly from utter weariness . / 
Now 
Dawn rose from her bed beside renowned 
Tithonus , bringing light to the deathless ones and to mortal men . 
The gods were seated in council , 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , greatest of all , among them . 
Athene was speaking of Odysseus� many sufferings , recalling them to their minds , unhappy that he was still a prisoner in Calypso�s isle : / �Father

He suffers misery in the island home of the nymph 
Calypso , who keeps him captive there .

Pylos and noble 
Sparta , where he went seeking news of his father . � / 
Cloud-Gathering 
Zeus replied : �My child , what words escape your lips ?

He quickly fastened to his feet the lovely imperishable golden sandals that carry him swift as the flowing wind over the ocean waves and the boundless earth . 
He took up the wand as well , with which he lulls men to sleep , or wakes them from slumber , and the mighty slayer of argus flew off with it in his hand . 
He 
stepped out of the ether onto the 
Pierian coast then swooped over the sea , skimming the waves like a cormorant that drenches its dense plumage with brine , as it searches for fish in the fearsome gulfs of the restless ocean . 
So 
Hermes travelled over the endless breakers , until he reached the distant isle , then leaving the violet sea he crossed the land , and came to the vast cave where the nymph of the lovely tresses lived , and found her at home . / a great fire blazed on the hearth , and the scent of burning cedar logs and juniper spread far across the isle .

Around the cave grew a thick copse of alder , poplar and fragrant cypress , where large birds nested , owls , and falcons , and long-necked cormorants whose business is with the sea .

Nymph , mindful of Zeus� command , looked for valiant 
Odysseus . 
She found him sitting on the shore , his eyes as ever wet with tears , life�s sweetness ebbing from him in longing for his home , since the 
Nymph no longer pleased him . 
He was forced to sleep with her in the hollow cave at night , as she wished though he did not , but by day he sat among rocks or sand , tormenting himself with tears , groans and anguish , gazing with wet eyes at the restless sea . / 
The lovely goddess spoke as she approached him : �Be sad no longer , unhappy man , don�t waste your life in pining : I am ready and willing to send you on your way . 
Fell tall trees with the axe , make a substantial raft , and fasten planks across for decking , so it can carry you over the misty sea . 
And I will stock it with bread and water , and red wine to your heart�s content , to stave off hunger and thirst , and I�ll give you clothing too . 
And I�ll raise a following wind , so you reach home safely , if that is the will of the gods who rule the wide heavens , since they have more power than I to fulfil their purpose . � / At this noble enduring 
Odysseus shuddered , and he spoke to her winged words : �Goddess , you must mean something other , suggesting I cross the dangerous , daunting sea�s vast gulf on a raft , where not even the fine swift sailing ships go , enjoying the winds of 
Zeus . I will not trust myself to a raft when you do not wish it , unless you , goddess , give me your solemn word that you are not planning something new to harm me . � / 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , smiled at his words and , stroking his arm , replied : �What a rascal you are , with a devious mind , to think of speaking so to me ? 
So let 
Earth be my witness 
now , and the underground waters of 
Styx , this the blessed gods� greatest most dreadful oath , that I will not plan anything new to harm you . Rather my thoughts and advice are like those I would have for myself if I needed them . 
My intentions are honest ones , and my heart is not made of iron . 
It too can feel pity . � / 
With this , the lovely goddess swiftly walked away , and he followed in her footsteps . man and goddess reached the hollow cave , and he sat down on the chair that 
Hermes had used . 
Then the 
Nymph set all kinds of food and drink before him , those that mortals consume . but before her the maids set ambrosia and nectar , as she sat facing divine 
Odysseus . 
So they reached for the good things prepared for them . 
And when they had finished eating and drinking , 
Calypso , that lovely goddess , spoke first : �Son of 
Laertes , scion of 
Zeus , 
Odysseus of many resources , must you leave , like this , so soon ? 
Still , let fortune go with you . 
Though if your heart knew the depths of anguish you are fated to suffer before you reach home , you would stay and make your home with me , and be immortal , no matter how much you long to see that wife you yearn for day after day . I am surely no less than her , I contend , in height or form , since no woman can reasonably compete with the gods in form or face . � / 
Then resourceful 
Odysseus replied to her : �Great goddess , do not be angry at what I say . I know myself that wise 
Penelope is less than you , it�s true , in looks and stature , being a mortal , while you are immortal and ever young . 
Even so I yearn day after day , longing to reach home , and see the hour of my 
return . 
And if some god should strike me , out on the wine-dark sea , I will endure it , owning a heart within inured to suffering . for I have suffered much , and laboured much , in war and on the seas : add this then to the sum . � / as he spoke the sun dipped , and darkness fell . 
And the two of them found the deepest recess of the hollow cave , and delighted together in their lovemaking . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
Odysseus dressed in tunic and cloak , and the 
Nymph clothed herself in a long white robe , lovely and closely woven , and fastened a fine gold belt around her waist , and covered her head with a veil . 
Then she began to prepare valiant Odysseus� departure . 
She gave him a bronze double axe that fitted his hands well , one with its blades both sharpened , its fine olivewood handle firmly fixed , and a polished adze as well . 
She led the way to the fringes of the island where stands of alder , poplar , and fir rose to the sky : dry , well-seasoned timber that would ride high in the water . 
When she had shown him where the tall trees stood , 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , turned for home , while he began felling timber , making rapid progress . 
He cut down twenty trees in total , trimming them with the axe : then he smoothed them dextrously , and made their edges true . 
Meanwhile 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , brought him drills , and he bored through the timbers then joined them , hammering the mortice and tenon joints together . 
Odysseus made his raft as wide as a skilled shipwright makes the hull of a broad-beamed trading vessel . 
And he placed the decking , bolting the planks to the close-set timbers as he worked , completing the raft with long gunwales . 
He fixed up a mast and yardarm , and a steering oar for a rudder . 
Then he lined its sides from stem to stern with intertwined willows , as a defence against the sea , and covered the deck with brushwood . 
Meanwhile 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , had brought him the cloth for a sail , and he skilfully fashioned that too . 
Then he lashed the braces , halyards and sheets in place , and levered it down to the shining sea . / by the fourth day all his work was done , and on the fifth lovely 
Calypso bathed him and dressed him in scented clothes , and watched him set out . 
The goddess had placed a skin filled with dark wine on board , and a larger one of water , and a bag of provisions , full of many good things to content his heart , and she sent a fine breeze , warm and gentle . 
Odysseus spread his sail to the wind with joy , and steered the raft cleverly with the oar as he sat there . At night he never closed his eyes in sleep , but watched the Pleiades , late-setting 
Bootes , and the 
Great 
Bear that men call the 
Wain , that circles in place opposite 
Orion , and never bathes in the sea . 
Calypso , the lovely goddess had told him to keep that constellation to larboard as he crossed the waters . Seventeen days he sailed the seas , and on the eighteenth the shadowy peaks of the 
Phaeacian country loomed up ahead , like a shield on the misty sea . / but 
now lord 
Poseidon , the 
Earth-Shaker , returning from visiting 
Ethiopia , saw him far off from the 
Solymi range , as he came in sight over the water : and the god , angered in spirit , shook his head , and said to himself : �Well 
now , while I was among the 
Ethiopians , the gods have certainly changed their minds about 
Odysseus ! 
Here he is , close to 
Phaeacian country , where he�s fated to escape his trials and tribulations . but I�ll give him his fill of trouble yet . � / 
With that , he gathered the cloud , and seizing his trident in his hands , stirred up the sea , and roused the tempest blast of every wind , and hid the land and sea with vapour : and darkness swooped from the sky . 
The 
East 
Wind and 
South 
Wind clashed together , and the stormy 
West 
Wind , and the heaven-born 
North 
Wind , 
driving a vast wave before him . 
Then Odysseus� knee-joints slackened and his heart melted , and deeply shaken he communed with his own valiant spirit : �Oh , wretch that I am , what will become of me ? I fear the goddess spoke true when she said I would k
now full measure of suffering at sea before I reached my own country : now all is coming to pass . 
Zeus has covered the wide heavens with cloud , and troubled the sea , and the tempest blast of every wind sweeps over me : 
now I am doomed for sure . Thrice blessed , four times blessed those 
Danaans who died long ago on Troy�s wide plain working the will of the sons of 
Atreus . I wish I had met my fate like them , and died on that day when the 
Trojan host hurled their bronze-tipped spears at me while we fought for the corpse of 
Achilles , son of Peleus . 
Then I would have had proper burial , and the 
Achaeans would have trumpeted my fame , but 
now I am destined to die a miserable death . � / 
Even as he thought this , a great wave , sweeping down with terrible power , crashed over him , and whirled his raft around . 
Loosing the steering oar , he was thrown far from the raft , while a savage blast of tempestuous wind snapped the mast in two , and yardarm and sail fell far off in the sea . long the wave held him under , for the clothes 
Calypso gave him weighed him down , and he could not surface from under the great wave�s flow . At last he rose , and spat out bitter brine that ran too in streams from his hair . 
Labouring as he was , he still remembered the raft , lunged after it through the breakers , holding tight clambered to its centre , and sat there , trying to escape a deadly fate : and the heavy seas carried the raft to and fro in their path . 
Just as in autumn the 
North 
Wind blows a ball of thistle tufts , clinging together , over the fields , so the winds drove the raft to and fro over the sea . 
Now the 
South 
Wind flung it to the 
North 
Wind to be played with , then the 
East 
Wind gave it to the 
West 
Wind in play . / but 
Leucothea , the 
White 
Goddess , saw him , she who once had mortal speech as 
Ino of the slender ankles , Cadmus� daughter , but 
now in the deep is honoured by the gods . 
She 
pitied 
Odysseus , driven on , surrounded by dangers , and she rose from the waves like a sea mew on the wing , settled on the close-knit raft , and spoke to him : / �Poor wretch , why has 
Poseidon , the 
Earth-Shaker , dealt you such fierce suffering , sowing the seed of endless misery for you ? 
Yet for all his anger he shall not destroy you quite . 
You seem a man of sense , so do as I tell you . strip off these clothes , and let the wind take your raft , while you swim hard towards the 
Phaeacian coast , where you are destined to escape the waves . 
And take this veil , and wind it round your waist . 
It has divine power , and you need not fear injury or death . but when you clasp the land , unwind it once more , and cast it far out onto the wine-dark sea , and turn your eyes away . � / 
With this , the goddess gave him the veil , and like a sea mew dived at the stormy sea , and the dark wave covered her . 
Then long-suffering noble 
Odysseus thought long and hard , and , deeply shaken , communed with his valiant spirit : �Oh , let this not be one of the deathless ones , weaving a net for me , telling me to abandon the raft . I will not obey her yet , since the land , she said I would escape to , was far away when I saw it . 
This I shall do , and this seems best , to wait here as long as the timbers hold , and endure in misery , then if the seas beat the raft to pieces , swim , for want of a better plan . � / 
While he reflected in mind and heart , 
Poseidon , 
Earth-Shaker , raised another fearsome , threatening wave , arched above 
Odysseus , then hurled it down on him . 
Like a strong wind catching a pile of dry straw , scattering the stalks here and there , so the breaker scattered the raft�s timbers . but 
Odysseus straddled a plank , like a horseman , and stripped off the clothes lovely 
Calypso had given him . 
Then he wound the veil round his waist , and arms outstretched plunged into the sea , prepared to swim . lord 
Poseidon saw him , and shook his head , saying to himself : �Well then , after all that , you can drift through the sea till you come to men favoured by 
Zeus . 
Still I don�t think you�ll find it easy . � 
And with that he lashed his horses , with beautiful manes , and headed for his glorious palace at 
Aegae . / but 
Athene , daughter of 
Zeus , had an idea . 
She checked the winds in their course , and ordered them all to stop , and sink to rest , except for the swift 
North 
Wind , and him she commanded to smooth the waves ahead of the swimmer , so that 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , might escape from fate and death , and reach the 
Phaeacians , who love the oar . / 
Two nights and days he was tossed about on the swollen sea , and many a time he thought himself doomed . but when 
Dawn of the lovely tresses gave birth to the third day , the wind dropped , and there was breathless calm . 
Glancing ahead as a long breaker suddenly lifted him , he glimpsed the shore nearby . 
Just as a father�s recovery is welcome to his children when , to their joy , the gods free him from sickness , from the grip of some evil force that caused great pain , and long wasted him , so the wooded shore was welcome to 
Odysseus . 
He swam on , eager to reach solid ground . but , within shouting distance of the land , he heard the thunder of surf on rock , as powerful waves battered the coast , veiling the sea with spray . 
There was no safe harbour , no roadstead for ships to ride in , only jutting reefs and rocky cliffs and headlands . 
Then Odysseus� knee-joints slackened and his heart melted , and deeply shaken he communed with his valiant spirit : / �Oh , 
now 
Zeus has allowed me to reach land , beyond all expectation , and I have managed to carve my way across the deep , there seems no way to escape the grey waters . offshore are pointed reefs that the waves roar over , foaming : the rock is sheer , and the water deep close in , so a man can�t find his footing and escape from danger . if I try to get ashore a breaker may catch me , and dash me against the jagged rocks , and my labours will be in vain . if I swim on in hope of finding a shelving beach and a natural harbour , I fear a squall may strike again and carry me groaning out to sea , into the teeming deep , or some god may raise a monster from the void , like those herds great 
Amphitrite breeds . I know the 
Earth-Shaker means me harm . � / as he considered all this in heart and mind , a large wave drove him towards the splintered shore . 
There his skin would have been stripped , and his bones shattered , if the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had not given him an idea . Rushing by he clung to a rock with both hands , and hung there , groaning , till the wave had passed . 
So he survived , but with its backflow the wave caught him again , and took him , and drove him far out to sea . 
Just as pebbles stick to an octopus� suckers when it is dragged from its crevice , so pieces of skin stripped from his sturdy hands stuck to the rock , and the wave swallowed him . 
Then wretched 
Odysseus would surely have come to a premature end , if bright-eyed 
Athene had not sharpened his wits . 
Freeing himself from the surge breaking on shore , he swam outside it , staring towards the land , hoping to find a shelving beach or a natural harbour . 
Then , swimming , he came to the mouth of a swift-running river that seemed a good place , free of stones , and sheltered from the wind . 
He felt the current flowing , and prayed to the river god : / �Hear me , lord , whoever you might be . I come to you , as to one who is greatly longed for , as I try to escape the sea and Poseidon�s menace . 
Even to the eyes of the deathless gods that man is sacred who comes as a wanderer , as I come to your stream , to your knees , after many trials . 
Pity me , lord , I am your suppliant . � / as he ended , the god stemmed the current , held back the waves , and smoothed the water ahead , so bringing him safely to the river mouth . His knees gave way , and his arms fell slack , his strength exhausted by the sea . 
All his flesh was swollen , and streams of brine oozed from his mouth and nostrils . 
So he lay there , breathless , speechless , with barely energy enough to stir . but as he revived his spirits rose , and he unwound the goddess�s veil and dropped it into the ocean-bound flow : the current sweeping it downstream , so it was soon in Ino�s hands . 
Odysseus turned from the river , sank into the reeds and kissed the earth , giver of crops : and deeply shaken he communed with his valiant spirit : / �Oh , what will become of me ? 
What is my fate ? if I lie awake in the riverbed here , through the weary night , I fear the bitter cold and the dewfall may conquer my labouring heart , weak as it is , and river breezes blow chill at dawn . but if I climb the slope to the shadowy wood , and lie down in a dense thicket , hoping to lessen the cold and fatigue , and fall softly asleep , I fear to become the prey of wild beasts . � / 
Still as he thought about it , the latter seemed best : he headed for the wood , and found a place near the water by a clearing : there he crept under a pair of bushes , a thorn and an olive , growing from the same spot . 
They grew so closely twined together that the force of the damp breeze , and the bright sunlight , and the 
driving rain failed to penetrate . Under these 
Odysseus crept . 
He quickly made a wide bed with his hands from the heaps of fallen leaves , enough there to cover two or three men from the bitterest winter weather . 
Gazing at it , long-suffering 
Odysseus was relieved , and lay down in the centre , and covered himself with the fallen leaves . as a farmer on a lonely farm buries a glowing log under the blackened embers , to preserve a spark of fire , so that he need not light it again from somewhere else , so 
Odysseus buried himself in the leaves . 
And 
Athene poured sleep into his eyes , so as to close his eyelids , and free him quickly from utter weariness . /
