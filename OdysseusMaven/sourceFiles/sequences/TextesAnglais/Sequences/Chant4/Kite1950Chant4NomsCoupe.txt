
Telemachus and 
Peisistratus arrive in 
Sparta / 
So 
they came to the hill country of 
Lacedaemon , with its deep gorges , and reached glorious Menelaus� palace . 
They found him at home feasting a crowd of his kin , celebrating the coming marriages of his faultless son and daughter . 
He was sending 
Hermione as bride to 
Neoptolemus , son of 
Achilles , that breaker of ranks of men , for he had promised her to him , and sworn an oath at 
Troy , and 
now the gods brought it about . 
He was to send her with chariots and horses to the Myrmidons� glorious 
city , whose king would be her lord . but to his son , the steadfast 
Megapenthes , he was bringing Alector�s daughter from 
Sparta : his son the dearly beloved child of a slave , for the gods gave 
Helen no more issue , once she had borne that lovely girl 
Hermione , whose beauty was golden Aphrodite�s . 
They were feasting then , 
happily , in the vaulted hall , glorious Menelaus� neighbours and family , while a minstrel , inspired , sang to the lyre , and two acrobats whirled about in dance through the midst of them . / 
Meanwhile 
Telemachus the hero , and Nestor�s noble son , reined in their horses at the palace gates . lord 
Eteoneus , great Menelaus� zealous squire , came out to see them , and went off through the halls to carry the news to the shepherd of the people . 
He approached him and spoke with winged words : �Menelaus , favourite of 
Zeus , two strangers are here , two men of mighty Zeus� divine seed . tell me , shall we un-harness their swift horses , or send them on to some other host who will give them hospitality ? � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus , 
replied , in intense annoyance : �You were never a fool before , 
Eteoneus , Boethus� son , but 
now you are babbling like a child . 
Both of us ate at other men�s tables on our way home , hoping that 
Zeus would free us from trouble some day . Un-harness the strangers� horses , 
now , and bring them to join our feast . � / At that , 
Eteoneus ran through the halls , calling the rest of the zealous squires to follow . 
They lifted the yoke from the sweating horses , and tied them to their stalls , then flung them a mix of wheat and white barley . 
They tilted the chariot against the gleaming wall of the court , and led the strangers into the goodly palace . 
They in turn wondered as 
they passed through the house of this king , favoured by 
Zeus : since a light like the sun or moon shone on the vaulted halls of noble 
Menelaus . / 
When 
they had feasted their eyes with gazing , 
they entered the gleaming baths and bathed , and when the maids had washed them and rubbed them with oil , and dressed them in fleece-lined tunics and cloaks , 
they seated themselves on chairs near 
Menelaus , son of 
Atreus . 
Then a maid brought a golden ewer , and poured water over a silver basin , while 
they rinsed their hands , and she drew a gleaming table to their side . 
The faithful housekeeper brought bread , and set it before them with heaps of delicacies , giving freely of her stores . 
And a carver served choice meats , setting the plates down before them , with gold cups beside . / 
Then yellow-haired 
Menelaus greeted the two of them , saying ; �Eat and be glad , and when you have eaten we will ask who you are , since your fathers� lineage is evident in you : you are of the race of sceptred kings favoured by 
Zeus , no common men 
could get such sons as you . � / 
So saying he lifted the roasted meat , the same fat chine of ox served to him as a mark of honour , and set it before them . 
And 
they stretched out their hands to the good things placed there . 
When 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , 
Telemachus leant close to Nestor�s son , so that the rest 
could not hear , saying : �Son of 
Nestor , dear to my heart , see the flashes of bronze in this echoing hall , the gleams of electrum , gold , silver , and ivory . 
The courts of 
Olympian 
Zeus must look like this , filled with such wealth : I am awed at the sight . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus overheard him , and spoke to them winged words : �No mortal man can compete with 
Zeus , my boy , of that you can be sure : his house and possessions endure forever . as for men , maybe someone somewhere can match me , or maybe no . 
After great suffering and many wanderings , in truth , I returned home with my riches in the eighth year . To 
Cyprus , 
Phoenicia , 
Egypt , I strayed : visited the 
Ethiopians , 
Sidonians , and 
Erembians , and 
Libya where the newborn lambs have horns . 
There the ewes lamb thrice a year : master or shepherd never lacks meat , sweet milk , and cheese , for the ewes give milk all year round . / 
Yet while I travelled there , garnering riches , my unsuspecting brother was killed by a murderer�s cunning , and the treachery of an accursed wife . 
So I take no joy in owning all this wealth , and , as you may have heard from your fathers , whoever 
they may be , I have had sorrows , and seen the ruin of one noble house already , filled with great treasure . I 
could be happy to live here with a third of this , if those men who 
died on the wide plains of 
Troy , far from the pastures of 
Argos , were still alive . 
And though I often sit here mourning and sorrowing for them , 
now easing my heart by weeping , 
now ceasing since men grow weary of cold sadness , I grieve for one more than all , nevertheless , thinking of whom makes me lose sleep and appetite : none of the 
Acheaeans laboured like 
Odysseus or endured so much . but it seems his only reward was misery , and mine the endless sorrow for him , through his long absence , not knowing if he is alive or dead . 
Old 
Laertes must grieve for him , and loyal 
Penelope , and 
Telemachus whom he left a newborn baby in his palace . � / His speech prompted 
Telemachus to weep for his father . Tears from his eyes fell to the ground at his father�s name , and he held his purple cloak before his eyes , in both hands . 
Menelaus marked him , and debated in his mind whether to let him speak of his father first , or whether to question him closely . / 
While he deliberated , from her tall , scented room came 
Helen , like 
Artemis of the golden spindle : and her companion Adreste placed a finely-wrought chair for her , 
Alcippe brought a soft wool rug , and 
Phylo a silver basket , a gift from 
Alcandre , wife of Polybus in 
Egyptian 
Thebes , where men own homes that reveal the greatest wealth . 
He had given 
Menelaus two silver baths , two three-legged cauldrons , and ten golden talents . 
And his wife had also offered beautiful gifts to 
Helen : a golden spindle , and a silver basket on wheels , with a golden rim . 
This was what 
Phylo , her maid , brought , placing it beside her . 
It was full of fine-spun yarn , and the spindle was laid across it , charged with dark purple wool . 
Helen was seated on the chair , with a footstool for her feet , and she quickly began to question her husband : / �Menelaus , favoured by 
Zeus , do we know who these men , in our house , claim to be ? 
Shall I suppress my thoughts , or speak truly ? 
My heart says speak . for I have never seen such a likeness before in man or woman , it stuns me to look , as the likeness of this man to great-hearted 
Odysseus : surely this is the son whom he left at home , a newborn babe , when you 
Achaeans came to the walls of 
Troy , meditating war , for me to my shame . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus 
replied : �I see the likeness 
now , wife , as you do : the hands and feet , the cast of his eyes , his head and hair . I swear , just 
now , when I spoke of 
Odysseus , and 
told of what he had done and suffered for me , the young man shed a bitter tear , and held his purple cloak to his brow , to veil his eyes . �Then 
Peisistratus , Nestor�s son , spoke to 
Menelaus : �Son of 
Atreus , favoured by 
Zeus , leader of armies , this young man is indeed his son , as you have said . but he is modest , and at this first visit is shy of speaking without invitation in the presence of one whose voice , like a god�s , delights us . as he was eager to see you , 
Gerenian 
Nestor sent me with him as guide , so that you might help him to word or action . for , as with 
Telemachus , when his father is absent a son has many sorrows at home , with no one to help him . His father is absent , and among his people there is no one to defend him from ruin . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus 
replied : �Well 
now : here in my house is the son of a man truly loved indeed , who suffered many troubles for my sake . I had thought , when he came back , to welcome him more than any other 
Argive : if 
Zeus of the far-reaching voice , that is , had allowed us to return together in our swift ships over the waves . I would have given him a 
city in 
Argos : I would have built him a palace , and brought him from Ithaca with all his possessions , his son and his people : emptied , indeed , some neighbouring 
city that obeyed me as its lord . 
Then we might have lived here together , with nothing to part us , loving , delighting in one another , until death�s black cloud covered us . but I think the god himself was jealous , and denied that man alone his homecoming . � / 
So he spoke , and prompted them to tears . 
Argive 
Helen , daughter of 
Zeus , was weeping , and 
Telemachus wept , and 
Menelaus , Atreus�s son , and the son of 
Nestor 
could not keep a dry eye , for he remembered faultless 
Antilochus , whom the Dawn�s glorious son , 
Memnon , had slain . 
Thinking of him he spoke with winged words : �Son of 
Atreus , old 
Nestor used to say you were the wisest of men , when we mentioned you and asked about you in the palace . 
So 
now , grant us a respite if you would . I take no delight in tears after eating , and soon the dawn will break : though there is nothing wrong in weeping for any mortal man who dies , and fulfils his fate . 
There are no greater tributes we can pay the sad dead , than a lock of our hair , and a tear from our eye . 
My brother too , not least of the 
Argives , is dead , a man you may well have known . I never saw him or met him , but 
they say 
Antilochus was swiftest of all afoot , and the best of warriors . � / �My friend� , answered yellow-haired 
Menelaus , �you have spoken like a wise man , and one of greater years : and are sprung from just such a father as your thoughtful words reveal . 
There is no hiding the man for whom the son of 
Cronos spins a thread of good luck at his marriage , and in his children�s birth , and he has done so for 
Nestor all his life , granting that he should attain a comfortable old age in his palace , and that his sons should be wise , and brave with the spear . 
So we will cease weeping , and let them pour water over our hands , while we think of supper . in the morning 
Telemachus and I will talk more fully . � 
So he spoke , and then 
Asphalion , glorious Menelaus� zealous squire , poured water over their hands . 
And 
they reached for the good things spread before them . / 
Then 
Helen , daughter of 
Zeus , thought to slip a drug into the wine 
they drank , one that calmed all pain and trouble , and brought forgetfulness of every evil . Whoever tasted it mixed with the wine would shed no tears that day , not though his mother and father lay there dead , not though 
they put his dear son or his brother to the sword , before his very eyes . 
The daughter of 
Zeus had these powerful healing drugs as a gift from 
Polydamna , Thon�s wife , a woman of 
Egypt , as the fertile soil there is rich in herbs , many of them curatives when compounded , many of them , also , harmful . Everyone there is the wisest of physicians , since 
they are of Paeeon�s race . / 
When she had mixed the drug , and ordered the wine to be poured , she spoke again , and said : �Menelaus , son of 
Atreus , favourite of 
Zeus , and all you others , sons of noblemen , though 
Zeus brings good or ill to one or another since he can do all things sit here in the hall and feast for 
now , and delight in the tales that are 
told , and I myself will relate something fitting . I cannot give you , or even number , enduring Odysseus� adventures , but what a wonderful thing it was that the great man undertook and survived at 
Troy where you 
Achaeans suffered ! 
Lacerating his body with fierce blows , and with a miserable rag about his shoulders , he entered the enemy�s broad flagged streets , looking like a slave . in that beggarly disguise , he was not the 
Odysseus of the 
Achaean ships , and all in the 
Trojan 
city were deceived . I alone recognised and questioned him , and he cunningly tried to deceive me . but when I had bathed him , anointed and clothed him , and solemnly sworn not to name him in 
Troy as 
Odysseus before he reached camp and the swift ships , he revealed the 
Achaean plans . 
And after slaying many 
Trojans with the long sword he returned to the 
Argive host with a wealth of information . 
While the rest of the 
Trojan women were wailing their grief , my spirit was glad , since my heart was already longing for home , and I sighed at the blindness 
Aphrodite had dealt me , drawing me there from my own dear country , abandoning daughter and bridal chamber , and a husband lacking neither in wisdom nor looks . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus 
continued : �Wife , indeed you have 
told it all as it was . I have k
nown before now the thoughts and judgements of many heroes , as I wandered the wide earth , but I have never seen so great hearted a man as enduring 
Odysseus . 
That episode too , of the 
Wooden 
Horse , how the great man planned it , carried it through , that carved horse holding the 
Argive leaders , bringing the 
Trojans death and ruin ! 
Then , summoned it may be by some god who thought to hand victory to the 
Trojans , you arrived , with godlike Deiphobus on your heels . 
You circled our hollow hiding-place , striking the surface , calling out the names of the 
Danaan captains , in the very voices of each of the Argives� wives . 
Diomedes , Tydeus� son , and I , and 
Odysseus were there among them , hearing you call , and 
Diomedes and I were ready to answer within , and leap out , but 
Odysseus restrained us , despite our eagerness . 
The rest of the 
Achaeans kept silent too , though 
Anticlus wanted to call out , and reply , till 
Odysseus 
clapped his strong hands over his mouth , saving all the 
Achaeans , and he grasped him so till 
Pallas 
Athene led you away . � / �Menelaus , son of 
Atreus , favourite of 
Zeus , leader of armies� said wise 
Telemachus , �it seems so much worse that nothing protected him from sad ruin , not even his iron will . but come , order us to retire , so that we may be lulled by sweet sleep , and delight in rest . � / At this , 
Argive 
Helen 
told her maids to set up two beds in the portico , and cover them with fine purple blankets , with covers on top , and fleecy cloaks for warmth . Torch in hand , the maids went out of the hall . 
They made up the couches , and a squire led the guests there . 
So brave 
Telemachus and Nestor�s glorious son spent the night in the palace forecourt , but Atreus� son slept in the innermost room of the tall palace , and beside him 
Helen , in her long robes , loveliest of women . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
Menelaus of the loud war cry rose from his bed and dressed . 
He slung a sharp sword from his shoulder , bound fine sandals on his shining feet , and went out of the room looking like a god . 
He seated himself by 
Telemachus , and addressed him : �Brave 
Telemachus , what brings you to lovely 
Lacedaemon , over the sea�s broad path ? 
Is it public or private business ? tell me 
now . � / 
And wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Menelaus , son of 
Atreus , favourite of 
Zeus , leader of armies , I came hoping for news of my father . 
My house is being ruined , and my rich lands destroyed : my home is filled with enemies , who kill my herds of sheep and shambling cattle with spiral horns : men who are my mother�s 
Suitors , proud in their insolence . 
So I come to clasp your knees , and ask you to speak , if you can and will , of his sad death , a death you may have seen yourself , or heard tell of from other travellers : for he was a man whom his mother bore to sorrow beyond all men . 
And do not speak soothing words out of concern for me , or pity , but tell me , in truth , what news you have . if ever my father , good 
Odysseus , promised you word or action , and fulfilled it on that field of 
Troy where 
Achaeans suffered , I beg you , remember it 
now : tell me the whole truth . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus expressed his deep indignation : �Rogues , men without courage , 
they are , who wish to creep into a brave man�s bed . 
Odysseus will bring them to a cruel end , just as if a doe had left twin newborn fawns asleep in some great lion�s lair in the bush , and gone for food on the mountain slopes , and in the grassy valleys , and the lion returned to its den and brought them to a cruel end . by 
Father 
Zeus , 
Athene , and 
Apollo , I wish he would come among those 
Suitors with that strength he showed in well-ordered 
Lesbos , when he rose to wrestle with Philomeleides , and threw him mightily , to all the Achaeans� delight . 
They would meet death swiftly , and a dark wedding . but concerning what you ask of me , I will not evade you , or mislead you : on the contrary , I will not hide a single fact of all that the infallible 
Old man of the 
Sea 
told me . � / �Though I was anxious to return , the gods kept me in 
Egypt , because I failed to offer the right sacrifice , and 
they want men ever to remember their commandments . 
Now there is an isle in the sea-surge off the mouth of the 
Nile , that men call Pharos , a day�s run for a hollow ship with a strong wind astern . There�s a good anchorage there , a harbour from which men launch their trim ships into the waves , when 
they have drawn fresh black water . 
The gods kept me there for twenty days , with never a sign of wind on the sea to speed our ship over the wide waters . All my stores , and my crew�s strength would have been lost , if a divinity had not pitied me and saved me . Eidothee , it was , the daughter of mighty proteus , 
Old man of the 
Sea , because I stirred her heart most of all . 
She met me as I walked alone , far from my men , who , pinched by hunger , roamed the shore fishing with barbed hooks . / 
She approached me , saying : �Stranger , are you a fool and slow-witted , or willingly trapped , and happy to suffer ? 
You have been penned here so long you can see no end to it , and your men are losing heart . � 
So she spoke and I 
replied : �Whichever of the goddesses you are , I assure you I am not willingly trapped here , but it seems I have sinned against the deathless ones who hold the wide heavens . tell me , since you gods know everything , which of the immortals holds me here , hindering my path , and tell me how to return over the teeming sea . � / I spoke , and the lovely goddess quickly answered : �Stranger , I will tell you truthfully all you ask . 
This is the haunt of the 
Old man of the 
Sea , proteus of 
Egypt , immortal seer , who knows all the ocean depths , and serves 
Poseidon . 
They say he is my true father . if you 
could lie in wait and trap him somehow , he will give you the course , and duration , and say how you may return over the teeming sea . 
And if you wish it so , favoured of 
Zeus , he will tell you the good and evil done in your house while you have been on your long and troubled passage . � / At this , I said : �Find me a way to lie in wait for this ancient god in case he sees me first , and avoids me . 
It is hard for a mortal man to defeat a god . �� / �She 
replied : �Stranger , I will tell you truthfully all you ask . 
When the sun is at the zenith , the wise 
Old man of the 
Sea emerges from the brine , masked by the dark wave , while the west wind blows . once risen , he lies down and sleeps in an echoing cave , and the seals , the daughter of the sea�s children , slithering from the grey water , lie down around him in a slumbering herd , breathing out the pungent odour of the deep . Choose three of your friends , the best you have in the oared ships , and at dawn I�ll lead you there and place you among their ranks . let me tell you the old sorcerer�s tricks . 
First he will go round counting the seals , and when he has looked them over , and tallied them in fives , he will lie down among them like a shepherd with his flock . 
When you see him settled , summon your strength and courage , and grasp him , however hard he struggles and tries to escape . 
Try he will , taking on the forms of everything on earth , of water and glorious blazing fire . but hold him bravely and grip him all the tighter . 
When he is finally willing to speak , and assumes the original shape in which you saw him resting , and questions you , then cease your violence , set the old man free , brave hero , and ask what god it is you have angered , and how you might return over the teeming waves . � / 
With that she plunged beneath the surge , and I went to where my ship lay on the shore , and my mind was filled with dark thoughts as I went . 
Then , when I had reached the ships and the waves , and we had prepared our supper , and deathless night descended , we lay down to sleep at the water�s edge . 
And as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , I walked along the shore of the wide seaway , praying devoutly to the gods : and three of my friends , on whom I 
could most rely , went with me . / 
She , meanwhile , plunging beneath the sea�s wide back , brought four sealskins up from the deep , freshly flayed , and plotted her father�s capture . 
She scooped out hiding places for us in the dunes , and sat there waiting : then , when we arrived , she made us lie in a row , and threw a seal skin over each . Our waiting would have been dreadful , so dreadful was the stench of the briny seals . 
Who would want to sleep with a beast from the sea ? but her gift saved us : she applied ambrosia to each man�s nostrils , and its sublime fragrance killed the stench . 
There we waited , patiently , all morning , and herds of seals came up from the sea . 
They lay down in rows along the beach , and at noon the old man emerged and found the sleek ranks . 
He looked them over , and tallied them , and not expecting our deceit , counted us among the first . 
Then he lay down to sleep . 
With a shout we rushed at him , and grappled him , but he forgot none of his crafty tricks . 
First he turned to a bearded lion , then a snake , and a leopard : then a giant boar : then he became rushing water , then a vast leafy tree : but we held tight with unyielding courage . 
When at last that old man , expert in magic arts , grew tired , he spoke to me , saying : �Son of 
Atreus , which of the gods 
told you to lie in wait for me , and hold me against my will ? 
What is it you wish ? �� / �At this , I answered : �Old man , why prevaricate , you know how long I have been penned in this isle , with no sign of an end to it , and how I lose heart . tell me , since you gods know everything , which of the immortals holds me here , hindering my passage , and tell me how to return over the teeming sea . � / 
He 
replied at once : �Surely you should have made rich sacrifice to 
Zeus and the other gods before you left , so as to return home faster , crossing the wine-dark sea . 
It is not your fate to reach your native land , and see your fine house and friends again , until you have sailed the waters of the 
Nile once more , 
Aegyptus , the heaven-fed river , and made holy offerings to the deathless gods who hold the wide heavens . 
Then , at last , the gods will let you return as you wish . � / At this my spirits fell , since he directed me to sail the long and weary way over the misty deep to 
Aegyptus . Even so I answered : �I will do all this , old man , as you suggest . but tell me this , in truth . have all the 
Achaeans whom 
Nestor and I left behind , as we sailed from 
Troy , reached home in safety with their ships ? or have any 
died a wretched death at sea , or in the arms of friends , though the war was over ? � / �Son of Atreus� , he 
replied swiftly , �why do you ask me this ? 
There is no benefit to you in knowing what I know , and when you have heard the truth , your tears will not be long in flowing . 
Many were killed , many were spared : yet only two of the bronze-clad 
Achaeans were lost on the homeward journey , and as for the fighting you were there . 
And a third I think is alive still , but a prisoner somewhere on the wide seas . / ajax the 
Lesser , first , was lost , with his long-oared ships . 
Poseidon wrecked him on the great cliffs of 
Gyrae , but rescued him from the waves . 
He would have avoided death , regardless of Athene�s hatred , if he had not boasted blindly . 
He claimed he had escaped the sea�s vast gulf despite the gods , and 
Poseidon heard his boast . 
Seizing his trident in his mighty hands the god struck the rock of 
Gyrae and split it apart . 
One part stood firm , but the shattered half , where ajax had crouched when his judgement was blinded , toppled into the sea , and drove him down into the vast surging tide . 
So he drank the salt waves , and 
died . �� / ��But your brother escaped that fate , and slipped by with his hollow ships , protected by lady 
Hera . 
Yet , as he neared the heights of cape Malea , a tempest caught him and drove him , groaning deeply , over the teeming waves , to the edge of that land where Thyestes once ruled , and at that time his son 
Aegisthus . but there the gods altered the wind�s course : a fair breeze blew and showed him the safe path home . 
Agamemnon was overjoyed to set foot again on his native soil , lying down he kissed the ground , and the tears streamed from his eyes , at the sight of his own land . 
Now a lookout saw him from the watchtower , a man appointed by cunning 
Aegisthus , who had promised him two golden talents . 
There he had watched for a year , fearful lest 
Agamemnon should pass unnoticed , and employ his strength in swift anger . 
He ran to the palace to carry his news to the usurper , and 
Aegisthus at once devised an ambush . 
He picked twenty of his best men , who lay in wait in the palace , while he ordered a feast prepared on the far side of the hall . 
Then , his mind plotting murder , he set out in his chariot to welcome 
Agamemnon , shepherd of the people , and drew him unsuspecting to his doom . 
When he had feasted him , he killed him , like an ox felled at the manger . 
And none of the followers of Atreus� son were spared , and none of Aegisthus� men , but all were killed in the palace . � / At this my heart was broken , and I fell to the sands and wept . I no longer wished to live , to see the sun . but when I was weary of weeping and clutching the ground , the wise 
Old man of the 
Sea said : �Son of 
Atreus , enough of this endless grieving that gains you nothing . Better to head for your native land as fast as you can , and you will either find 
Aegisthus still alive , or 
Orestes will have killed him ahead of you , and you can join the funeral rites . �� / �My spirits rose and my heart was comforted by this , despite my sorrow , and I spoke to him with winged words : �I k
now now about these two , but what of the third ? Name the man who still lives somewhere in the wide sea : or is he too dead ? 
Despite the pain , I wish to know . � / I spoke , and he at once 
replied , saying : �He is 
Odysseus , Laertes� son , whose home is on Ithaca . I saw him shedding great tears in the 
island haunt of the 
Nymph 
Calypso , who keeps him captive there , far from his native land , since he has no oared ship , no crew , to carry him over the wide waters . but because you are Helen�s husband , and therefore the son-in-law of 
Zeus , it is not ordained that you , 
Menelaus , favoured by 
Zeus , should meet your end in 
Argos , the horse-pasture . 
Instead the immortals will bear you to the 
Elysian Fields , at the world�s end , where yellow-haired 
Rhadamanthus dwells , and existence is best for men . 
There is no snow there , no rain , or fierce storms : rather 
Ocean brings singing breaths of the 
West 
Wind , to refresh them . � / 
With this , he sank into the billowing sea , and I returned to my ships with my brave friends , thinking dark thoughts as I went . 
Then , when I had reached the ships and the waves , and we had prepared our supper , and immortal night descended , we lay down to sleep at the water�s edge . 
And as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , we dragged our ships to the glittering water , and set up masts and sails in the trim craft , and the crews went to their oars , and sitting in rows struck the grey sea with their blades . 
So I sailed again to the heaven-fed waters of 
Nile , and moored the ships , and offered true sacrifice . 
Then , when I had appeased the wrath of the ever-living gods , I heaped up a mound to 
Agamemnon , so his fame might endure . 
When all was done I headed home , and the immortals sent me a following wind , and brought me quickly to my own beloved country . / but stay here in the palace , till the eleventh or the twelfth day , and I will send you off with honours , and fine gifts , a shining chariot with a trio of horses , and a glorious cup with which to pour libations to the deathless gods , while remembering me all your days . � / 
Then wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Son of 
Atreus , do not delay me here . Truly I 
could be happy to stay a year in your palace , without desiring home or parents , so great is the pleasure I take listening to your speech , your tales . but my friends will be anxious in sacred 
Pylos while you detain me . if you make me a gift , let it be something precious . but I will not accept horses for 
Ithaca , I will leave them here for you to enjoy , since you are lord of a wide land , where lotus and sedge , and wheat and rye , and broad-eared white barley grow , while in Ithaca there are no broad plains or meadows at all . It is goat-pasture , though more varied than fields for horses . none of those islands that slope sheer to the sea are rich in meadows fit for herding them , Ithaca least of all . � / 
So saying , 
Menelaus of the loud war cry smiled , and patted him with his hand , and answered : �Dear boy , you are of noble blood , to speak so . 
Well , I will alter the gifts , as I may . I will give you one of the richest and loveliest treasures of my house , a finely fashioned mixing bowl . 
It is solid silver with a rim of gold , the work of 
Hephaestus himself . 
Phaedimus , the hero , 
King of 
Sidon , made me a present of it , when his house gave me shelter on my way home , and 
now I wish to present it to you . � / 
While 
they conversed , the guests were arriving at the sacred king�s palace . 
They drove in their sheep , and brought unmixed wine , and their elegantly veiled wives sent bread . 
So 
they prepared the feast in the hall . / but in front of Odysseus� palace the 
Suitors , insolent as ever , were amusing themselves hurling the discus and javelin across the level space . 
Antinous and noble 
Eurymachus , their leaders , were there , the most able of them all . 
Noemon , Phronius� son , approached with a question for 
Antinous : / �Do we know or not when 
Telemachus is due back from sandy 
Pylos ? 
He has taken a ship of mine , and gone , and I need her to cross to the wide plains of 
Elis , where I have twelve brood mares , and sturdy mules that are not yet weaned or broken . I need to cut one out , and train him . � / 
They were amazed at this , not thinking 
Telemachus had gone to 
Neleian 
Pylos , but that he was in the field , among the flocks perhaps , or with the swineherd . / 
Then 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , said : �Tell me the truth 
now , when did he go , and who went with him ? 
Were 
they picked men of Ithaca , or slaves and servants of his own ? 
He might have so decided . 
And tell me so as to convince me . 
Did he take the black ship from you against your will , or did you agree willingly when he asked you ? � / �I gave it him freely . � said 
Noemon , �What else can one do when a man like him , burdened with care , makes a request ? 
It would be hard to refuse the gift . 
And the best of the island�s young men , next to us , went with him . I saw mentor take command of them on board , or a god perhaps who looked like mentor . I wonder at it , since I saw noble mentor here , yesterday , at dawn : yet earlier he had embarked for 
Pylos . � / 
With that 
Noemon left for his father�s house , leaving the two proud lords enraged . 
They insisted the 
Suitors leave their games , at once , and sit down together , while 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , vented his anger . His dark spirit was filled with fury , and his eyes blazed with fire . / �Well 
now , 
Telemachus has carried this out , insolently indeed , a journey we thought he would never manage . 
The lad went swiftly , in spite of us , and launched his ship , with a hand picked crew . Given time he will start to cause us problems : may 
Zeus humble him though , and destroy him before he reaches manhood . but come , grant me a fast ship and a crew of twenty , and I�ll lie in wait for him in the straits as he makes his solitary passage between Ithaca and rocky 
Samos , and his voyage in search of his father will end sadly . � / 
They praised his speech , and seconded his plan . 
Then 
they quickly rose and went off towards Odysseus� palace . / 
Now 
Penelope was not long in ignorance of what the 
Suitors were secretly plotting , for 
Medon , the herald 
told her , having heard their plans as he stood outside the court where 
they were weaving their mischief . 
He set off through the palace , to carry the news to 
Penelope , and she spoke to him as he crossed her threshold : / �Why have the noble 
Suitors sent you , 
Herald ? 
Is it to tell divine Odysseus� maids to forgo their tasks , and prepare them a feast ? 
May this be their latest feast and their last , so 
they will never woo or gather anywhere else again . 
They are always crowding in here , wasting our stores , and wise Telemachus� inheritance . 
They 
could never have listened when 
they were children , and their fathers talked of how 
Odysseus treated them , never unjust to any man in word or action , as sacred kings often are : disliking one man , while favouring another . 
He never dealt unfairly with anyone . but their thoughts and shameful actions are evident , and gratitude for past goodness is 
now forgotten . � / 
Then thoughtful 
Medon 
replied : �My 
Queen , I wish that was the worst of it . but the 
Suitors are planning a greater evil , one I pray the son of 
Cronos may never allow . 
They plan to put 
Telemachus to the sword as he returns from his journey to sacred 
Pylos and noble 
Lacadaemon , seeking news of his father . � / At this her knee-joints slackened , and her heart melted . for a while she 
could not speak : her eyes filled with tears , her voice was stilled . At last she 
could reply : �Why did my son go there , 
Herald ? 
He had no need to sail the swift ships , those chariots of the deep , and cross the wide ocean waves . 
Is not even his name to be left among men ? � / 
Thoughtful 
Medon answered her : �I do not know whether a god drove him , or whether his own heart sent him to 
Pylos to learn of his father�s death or return . � 
So saying he walked off through Odysseus� palace , while a cloud of all-consuming anxiety cloaked her , such that she had no strength to seat herself on one of the many chairs in the room , but sank down on the threshold of her well-made chamber , grieving pitifully , while all the maids of the household , young and old , wept around her . / 
Sobbing with grief , 
Penelope spoke to them : �Listen , my friends , for 
Zeus has charged me with sorrow beyond all the women of my generation . long ago I lost my great and glorious , lion-hearted husband , first among the 
Danaans in every virtue , whose fame resounds through Hellas to the heart of 
Argos . 
Now the storm wind has swept my beloved son from our door without trace , and I never even knew he had gone . cruel ones ! none of you thought to wake me from sleep , though you must have known he was boarding his hollow black ship ! if I had known he planned this voyage , every means would have been used to keep him here , however ready he was to be off , or he would have left me here dead . 
So 
now one of you run and call old 
Dolius , my servant . 
My father offered his service to me , when I came here , and he tends my well-stocked orchard . 
He can go and sit with 
Laertes , and tell him of this . Perhaps 
Laertes may think of some scheme , and show himself to the people , and beg them with tears not to destroy his and Odysseus� sacred line . � / 
Then 
Eurycleia , the loyal nurse , 
replied : �Odysseus� bride , dear lady , whether you let me live on in this house , or kill me with a pitiless knife , I cannot hide the truth from you . I knew all , and I gave him whatever he asked for , bread and pure wine . but he made me swear solemnly not to tell you , till eleven or twelve days hence , or till you missed him and heard he was gone , so as not to spoil your beauty with weeping . Go and bathe , and dress in fresh clothes , then go to your high chamber with your maids , and pray to 
Athene , daughter of 
Zeus , who wears the aegis : even 
now she may save your son from death . 
And don�t add to the old man�s troubles , since I hardly think the blessed gods hate the sons of Arceisius� line , and 
they will surely leave one to rule the vaulted halls , and all the rich far-flung land . � / 
So speaking , she 
soothed Penelope�s grief , and stemmed her tears . 
And the 
Queen bathed , and dressed in fresh clothes , and went to her high chamber with her maids , and filling a basket with barley grains she prayed to 
Athene . �Hear me , Atrytone , daughter of aegis-bearing 
Zeus ! if ever resourceful 
Odysseus burnt the fat thigh joints of ewe or heifer here in his palace for you , remember it 
now , I beg , and rescue my dear son , and prevent the 
Suitors in their insolent wickedness from harming him . � / 
She cried it aloud , and the goddess heard her prayer , but the 
Suitors caused uproar in the shadowy halls , and one of the arrogant youths called out : �The much-courted 
Queen is surely preparing herself for marriage , without knowing the death that awaits her son . � 
So he spoke , yet none of them foresaw the outcome . 
Then 
Antinous addressed them : �What possesses you ? 
Avoid these boastful words , lest your speech is reported elsewhere in the palace . rise silently , and execute the plan we all agreed on . � / 
He chose the twenty best men and 
they went down to the shore and a swift vessel . 
They drew it out into deep water , set up the mast and sails in that black ship , fixed the oars in their leather straps , in their rows , and raised the white sail . noble squires brought them their weapons . 
Then 
they moored the vessel well out in the channel , and returned on shore . 
There 
they ate supper and waited for evening . / but wise 
Penelope lay in her high chamber , without touching food , tasting neither meat nor drink , wondering whether her faultless son would escape death , or be killed by the insolent 
Suitors . 
Like a lioness , seized by fear , troubled by the tightening ring of cunning men around her , so she was troubled till sweet slumber captured her . 
She sank back , as all her limbs relaxed , and fell asleep . / 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had an idea . 
She created a phantom , in the likeness of Penelope�s sister , 
Iphthime , that other daughter of great-hearted 
Icarius . Eumelus had married her , and she was living at 
Pherae . 
Athene sent the phantom to noble Odysseus� palace , to the weeping , grieving 
Penelope , to tell her to stop her crying , her tear-filled lament . 
It entered her room past the strap of the bolt , stood by her head , and spoke to her : �Anxious 
Penelope , are you asleep ? 
The gods , themselves untroubled , do not wish you to weep with distress , since your son will return : in their eyes he has done no wrong . � / 
Wise 
Penelope answered her from her sweet sleep at the 
Gate of 
Dreams : �Sister , why are you here ? 
You are not used to visiting us , living so far away . do you tell me to dry my tears , and forget the pain in my mind and heart ? long ago I lost my great and glorious , lion-hearted husband , first among the 
Danaans in every virtue , whose fame resounds through Hellas to the heart of 
Argos . 
Now my beloved son , a mere child , untried in action and debate , has left in a hollow ship . I grieve for him more than the other , and tremble with fear lest anything harms him in the land he travels to or at sea . 
So many enemies plot against him , eager to kill him as he returns to his native isle . � / 
The shadowy phantom 
replied : �Be brave and do not fear overmuch , since he is guided by one whose power men pray to have at their side : it is 
Pallas 
Athene herself , who pities you in your grief , and has sent me with this message . � / 
Then wise 
Penelope answered once more : �If you are truly divine , and have heard her divine voice , tell me also whether his father , that man of sorrows , is still alive and sees the sun , or is dead in the house of Hades . � / but the shadowy phantom said to her : �No , I will speak no word of him , alive or dead : it is wrong to utter words idle as the wind . � 
With this , it slipped away past the bolt , into the breeze . 
And Icarius� daughter woke from sleep with a start , her heart comforted by the bright vision that had come to her in the dark of night . / 
The 
Suitors though had embarked , and were sailing the paths of the sea , intending secretly to murder 
Telemachus . in the open sea , midway between Ithaca and rugged 
Samos , there is a rocky islet , 
Asteris , where , despite its size , lies a good harbour with twin entrances . 
And there the 
Achaeans waited in ambush for 
Telemachus . / 
Telemachus and 
Peisistratus arrive in 
Sparta / 
So 
they came to the hill country of 
Lacedaemon , with its deep gorges , and reached glorious Menelaus� palace . 
They found him at home feasting a crowd of his kin , celebrating the coming marriages of his faultless son and daughter . 
He was sending 
Hermione as bride to 
Neoptolemus , son of 
Achilles , that breaker of ranks of men , for he had promised her to him , and sworn an oath at 
Troy , and 
now the gods brought it about . 
He was to send her with chariots and horses to the Myrmidons� glorious 
city , whose king would be her lord . but to his son , the steadfast 
Megapenthes , he was bringing Alector�s daughter from 
Sparta : his son the dearly beloved child of a slave , for the gods gave 
Helen no more issue , once she had borne that lovely girl 
Hermione , whose beauty was golden Aphrodite�s . 
They were feasting then , 
happily , in the vaulted hall , glorious Menelaus� neighbours and family , while a minstrel , inspired , sang to the lyre , and two acrobats whirled about in dance through the midst of them . / 
Meanwhile 
Telemachus the hero , and Nestor�s noble son , reined in their horses at the palace gates . lord 
Eteoneus , great Menelaus� zealous squire , came out to see them , and went off through the halls to carry the news to the shepherd of the people . 
He approached him and spoke with winged words : �Menelaus , favourite of 
Zeus , two strangers are here , two men of mighty Zeus� divine seed . tell me , shall we un-harness their swift horses , or send them on to some other host who will give them hospitality ? � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus , 
replied , in intense annoyance : �You were never a fool before , 
Eteoneus , Boethus� son , but 
now you are babbling like a child . 
Both of us ate at other men�s tables on our way home , hoping that 
Zeus would free us from trouble some day . Un-harness the strangers� horses , 
now , and bring them to join our feast . � / At that , 
Eteoneus ran through the halls , calling the rest of the zealous squires to follow . 
They lifted the yoke from the sweating horses , and tied them to their stalls , then flung them a mix of wheat and white barley . 
They tilted the chariot against the gleaming wall of the court , and led the strangers into the goodly palace . 
They in turn wondered as 
they passed through the house of this king , favoured by 
Zeus : since a light like the sun or moon shone on the vaulted halls of noble 
Menelaus . / 
When 
they had feasted their eyes with gazing , 
they entered the gleaming baths and bathed , and when the maids had washed them and rubbed them with oil , and dressed them in fleece-lined tunics and cloaks , 
they seated themselves on chairs near 
Menelaus , son of 
Atreus . 
Then a maid brought a golden ewer , and poured water over a silver basin , while 
they rinsed their hands , and she drew a gleaming table to their side . 
The faithful housekeeper brought bread , and set it before them with heaps of delicacies , giving freely of her stores . 
And a carver served choice meats , setting the plates down before them , with gold cups beside . / 
Then yellow-haired 
Menelaus greeted the two of them , saying ; �Eat and be glad , and when you have eaten we will ask who you are , since your fathers� lineage is evident in you : you are of the race of sceptred kings favoured by 
Zeus , no common men 
could get such sons as you . � / 
So saying he lifted the roasted meat , the same fat chine of ox served to him as a mark of honour , and set it before them . 
And 
they stretched out their hands to the good things placed there . 
When 
they had quenched their hunger and thirst , 
Telemachus leant close to Nestor�s son , so that the rest 
could not hear , saying : �Son of 
Nestor , dear to my heart , see the flashes of bronze in this echoing hall , the gleams of electrum , gold , silver , and ivory . 
The courts of 
Olympian 
Zeus must look like this , filled with such wealth : I am awed at the sight . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus overheard him , and spoke to them winged words : �No mortal man can compete with 
Zeus , my boy , of that you can be sure : his house and possessions endure forever . as for men , maybe someone somewhere can match me , or maybe no . 
After great suffering and many wanderings , in truth , I returned home with my riches in the eighth year . To 
Cyprus , 
Phoenicia , 
Egypt , I strayed : visited the 
Ethiopians , 
Sidonians , and 
Erembians , and 
Libya where the newborn lambs have horns . 
There the ewes lamb thrice a year : master or shepherd never lacks meat , sweet milk , and cheese , for the ewes give milk all year round . / 
Yet while I travelled there , garnering riches , my unsuspecting brother was killed by a murderer�s cunning , and the treachery of an accursed wife . 
So I take no joy in owning all this wealth , and , as you may have heard from your fathers , whoever 
they may be , I have had sorrows , and seen the ruin of one noble house already , filled with great treasure . I 
could be happy to live here with a third of this , if those men who 
died on the wide plains of 
Troy , far from the pastures of 
Argos , were still alive . 
And though I often sit here mourning and sorrowing for them , 
now easing my heart by weeping , 
now ceasing since men grow weary of cold sadness , I grieve for one more than all , nevertheless , thinking of whom makes me lose sleep and appetite : none of the 
Acheaeans laboured like 
Odysseus or endured so much . but it seems his only reward was misery , and mine the endless sorrow for him , through his long absence , not knowing if he is alive or dead . 
Old 
Laertes must grieve for him , and loyal 
Penelope , and 
Telemachus whom he left a newborn baby in his palace . � / His speech prompted 
Telemachus to weep for his father . Tears from his eyes fell to the ground at his father�s name , and he held his purple cloak before his eyes , in both hands . 
Menelaus marked him , and debated in his mind whether to let him speak of his father first , or whether to question him closely . / 
While he deliberated , from her tall , scented room came 
Helen , like 
Artemis of the golden spindle : and her companion Adreste placed a finely-wrought chair for her , 
Alcippe brought a soft wool rug , and 
Phylo a silver basket , a gift from 
Alcandre , wife of Polybus in 
Egyptian 
Thebes , where men own homes that reveal the greatest wealth . 
He had given 
Menelaus two silver baths , two three-legged cauldrons , and ten golden talents . 
And his wife had also offered beautiful gifts to 
Helen : a golden spindle , and a silver basket on wheels , with a golden rim . 
This was what 
Phylo , her maid , brought , placing it beside her . 
It was full of fine-spun yarn , and the spindle was laid across it , charged with dark purple wool . 
Helen was seated on the chair , with a footstool for her feet , and she quickly began to question her husband : / �Menelaus , favoured by 
Zeus , do we know who these men , in our house , claim to be ? 
Shall I suppress my thoughts , or speak truly ? 
My heart says speak . for I have never seen such a likeness before in man or woman , it stuns me to look , as the likeness of this man to great-hearted 
Odysseus : surely this is the son whom he left at home , a newborn babe , when you 
Achaeans came to the walls of 
Troy , meditating war , for me to my shame . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus 
replied : �I see the likeness 
now , wife , as you do : the hands and feet , the cast of his eyes , his head and hair . I swear , just 
now , when I spoke of 
Odysseus , and 
told of what he had done and suffered for me , the young man shed a bitter tear , and held his purple cloak to his brow , to veil his eyes . �Then 
Peisistratus , Nestor�s son , spoke to 
Menelaus : �Son of 
Atreus , favoured by 
Zeus , leader of armies , this young man is indeed his son , as you have said . but he is modest , and at this first visit is shy of speaking without invitation in the presence of one whose voice , like a god�s , delights us . as he was eager to see you , 
Gerenian 
Nestor sent me with him as guide , so that you might help him to word or action . for , as with 
Telemachus , when his father is absent a son has many sorrows at home , with no one to help him . His father is absent , and among his people there is no one to defend him from ruin . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus 
replied : �Well 
now : here in my house is the son of a man truly loved indeed , who suffered many troubles for my sake . I had thought , when he came back , to welcome him more than any other 
Argive : if 
Zeus of the far-reaching voice , that is , had allowed us to return together in our swift ships over the waves . I would have given him a 
city in 
Argos : I would have built him a palace , and brought him from Ithaca with all his possessions , his son and his people : emptied , indeed , some neighbouring 
city that obeyed me as its lord . 
Then we might have lived here together , with nothing to part us , loving , delighting in one another , until death�s black cloud covered us . but I think the god himself was jealous , and denied that man alone his homecoming . � / 
So he spoke , and prompted them to tears . 
Argive 
Helen , daughter of 
Zeus , was weeping , and 
Telemachus wept , and 
Menelaus , Atreus�s son , and the son of 
Nestor 
could not keep a dry eye , for he remembered faultless 
Antilochus , whom the Dawn�s glorious son , 
Memnon , had slain . 
Thinking of him he spoke with winged words : �Son of 
Atreus , old 
Nestor used to say you were the wisest of men , when we mentioned you and asked about you in the palace . 
So 
now , grant us a respite if you would . I take no delight in tears after eating , and soon the dawn will break : though there is nothing wrong in weeping for any mortal man who dies , and fulfils his fate . 
There are no greater tributes we can pay the sad dead , than a lock of our hair , and a tear from our eye . 
My brother too , not least of the 
Argives , is dead , a man you may well have known . I never saw him or met him , but 
they say 
Antilochus was swiftest of all afoot , and the best of warriors . � / �My friend� , answered yellow-haired 
Menelaus , �you have spoken like a wise man , and one of greater years : and are sprung from just such a father as your thoughtful words reveal . 
There is no hiding the man for whom the son of 
Cronos spins a thread of good luck at his marriage , and in his children�s birth , and he has done so for 
Nestor all his life , granting that he should attain a comfortable old age in his palace , and that his sons should be wise , and brave with the spear . 
So we will cease weeping , and let them pour water over our hands , while we think of supper . in the morning 
Telemachus and I will talk more fully . � 
So he spoke , and then 
Asphalion , glorious Menelaus� zealous squire , poured water over their hands . 
And 
they reached for the good things spread before them . / 
Then 
Helen , daughter of 
Zeus , thought to slip a drug into the wine 
they drank , one that calmed all pain and trouble , and brought forgetfulness of every evil . Whoever tasted it mixed with the wine would shed no tears that day , not though his mother and father lay there dead , not though 
they put his dear son or his brother to the sword , before his very eyes . 
The daughter of 
Zeus had these powerful healing drugs as a gift from 
Polydamna , Thon�s wife , a woman of 
Egypt , as the fertile soil there is rich in herbs , many of them curatives when compounded , many of them , also , harmful . Everyone there is the wisest of physicians , since 
they are of Paeeon�s race . / 
When she had mixed the drug , and ordered the wine to be poured , she spoke again , and said : �Menelaus , son of 
Atreus , favourite of 
Zeus , and all you others , sons of noblemen , though 
Zeus brings good or ill to one or another since he can do all things sit here in the hall and feast for 
now , and delight in the tales that are 
told , and I myself will relate something fitting . I cannot give you , or even number , enduring Odysseus� adventures , but what a wonderful thing it was that the great man undertook and survived at 
Troy where you 
Achaeans suffered ! 
Lacerating his body with fierce blows , and with a miserable rag about his shoulders , he entered the enemy�s broad flagged streets , looking like a slave . in that beggarly disguise , he was not the 
Odysseus of the 
Achaean ships , and all in the 
Trojan 
city were deceived . I alone recognised and questioned him , and he cunningly tried to deceive me . but when I had bathed him , anointed and clothed him , and solemnly sworn not to name him in 
Troy as 
Odysseus before he reached camp and the swift ships , he revealed the 
Achaean plans . 
And after slaying many 
Trojans with the long sword he returned to the 
Argive host with a wealth of information . 
While the rest of the 
Trojan women were wailing their grief , my spirit was glad , since my heart was already longing for home , and I sighed at the blindness 
Aphrodite had dealt me , drawing me there from my own dear country , abandoning daughter and bridal chamber , and a husband lacking neither in wisdom nor looks . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus 
continued : �Wife , indeed you have 
told it all as it was . I have k
nown before now the thoughts and judgements of many heroes , as I wandered the wide earth , but I have never seen so great hearted a man as enduring 
Odysseus . 
That episode too , of the 
Wooden 
Horse , how the great man planned it , carried it through , that carved horse holding the 
Argive leaders , bringing the 
Trojans death and ruin ! 
Then , summoned it may be by some god who thought to hand victory to the 
Trojans , you arrived , with godlike Deiphobus on your heels . 
You circled our hollow hiding-place , striking the surface , calling out the names of the 
Danaan captains , in the very voices of each of the Argives� wives . 
Diomedes , Tydeus� son , and I , and 
Odysseus were there among them , hearing you call , and 
Diomedes and I were ready to answer within , and leap out , but 
Odysseus restrained us , despite our eagerness . 
The rest of the 
Achaeans kept silent too , though 
Anticlus wanted to call out , and reply , till 
Odysseus 
clapped his strong hands over his mouth , saving all the 
Achaeans , and he grasped him so till 
Pallas 
Athene led you away . � / �Menelaus , son of 
Atreus , favourite of 
Zeus , leader of armies� said wise 
Telemachus , �it seems so much worse that nothing protected him from sad ruin , not even his iron will . but come , order us to retire , so that we may be lulled by sweet sleep , and delight in rest . � / At this , 
Argive 
Helen 
told her maids to set up two beds in the portico , and cover them with fine purple blankets , with covers on top , and fleecy cloaks for warmth . Torch in hand , the maids went out of the hall . 
They made up the couches , and a squire led the guests there . 
So brave 
Telemachus and Nestor�s glorious son spent the night in the palace forecourt , but Atreus� son slept in the innermost room of the tall palace , and beside him 
Helen , in her long robes , loveliest of women . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
Menelaus of the loud war cry rose from his bed and dressed . 
He slung a sharp sword from his shoulder , bound fine sandals on his shining feet , and went out of the room looking like a god . 
He seated himself by 
Telemachus , and addressed him : �Brave 
Telemachus , what brings you to lovely 
Lacedaemon , over the sea�s broad path ? 
Is it public or private business ? tell me 
now . � / 
And wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Menelaus , son of 
Atreus , favourite of 
Zeus , leader of armies , I came hoping for news of my father . 
My house is being ruined , and my rich lands destroyed : my home is filled with enemies , who kill my herds of sheep and shambling cattle with spiral horns : men who are my mother�s 
Suitors , proud in their insolence . 
So I come to clasp your knees , and ask you to speak , if you can and will , of his sad death , a death you may have seen yourself , or heard tell of from other travellers : for he was a man whom his mother bore to sorrow beyond all men . 
And do not speak soothing words out of concern for me , or pity , but tell me , in truth , what news you have . if ever my father , good 
Odysseus , promised you word or action , and fulfilled it on that field of 
Troy where 
Achaeans suffered , I beg you , remember it 
now : tell me the whole truth . � / Yellow-haired 
Menelaus expressed his deep indignation : �Rogues , men without courage , 
they are , who wish to creep into a brave man�s bed . 
Odysseus will bring them to a cruel end , just as if a doe had left twin newborn fawns asleep in some great lion�s lair in the bush , and gone for food on the mountain slopes , and in the grassy valleys , and the lion returned to its den and brought them to a cruel end . by 
Father 
Zeus , 
Athene , and 
Apollo , I wish he would come among those 
Suitors with that strength he showed in well-ordered 
Lesbos , when he rose to wrestle with Philomeleides , and threw him mightily , to all the Achaeans� delight . 
They would meet death swiftly , and a dark wedding . but concerning what you ask of me , I will not evade you , or mislead you : on the contrary , I will not hide a single fact of all that the infallible 
Old man of the 
Sea 
told me . � / �Though I was anxious to return , the gods kept me in 
Egypt , because I failed to offer the right sacrifice , and 
they want men ever to remember their commandments . 
Now there is an isle in the sea-surge off the mouth of the 
Nile , that men call Pharos , a day�s run for a hollow ship with a strong wind astern . There�s a good anchorage there , a harbour from which men launch their trim ships into the waves , when 
they have drawn fresh black water . 
The gods kept me there for twenty days , with never a sign of wind on the sea to speed our ship over the wide waters . All my stores , and my crew�s strength would have been lost , if a divinity had not pitied me and saved me . Eidothee , it was , the daughter of mighty proteus , 
Old man of the 
Sea , because I stirred her heart most of all . 
She met me as I walked alone , far from my men , who , pinched by hunger , roamed the shore fishing with barbed hooks . / 
She approached me , saying : �Stranger , are you a fool and slow-witted , or willingly trapped , and happy to suffer ? 
You have been penned here so long you can see no end to it , and your men are losing heart . � 
So she spoke and I 
replied : �Whichever of the goddesses you are , I assure you I am not willingly trapped here , but it seems I have sinned against the deathless ones who hold the wide heavens . tell me , since you gods know everything , which of the immortals holds me here , hindering my path , and tell me how to return over the teeming sea . � / I spoke , and the lovely goddess quickly answered : �Stranger , I will tell you truthfully all you ask . 
This is the haunt of the 
Old man of the 
Sea , proteus of 
Egypt , immortal seer , who knows all the ocean depths , and serves 
Poseidon . 
They say he is my true father . if you 
could lie in wait and trap him somehow , he will give you the course , and duration , and say how you may return over the teeming sea . 
And if you wish it so , favoured of 
Zeus , he will tell you the good and evil done in your house while you have been on your long and troubled passage . � / At this , I said : �Find me a way to lie in wait for this ancient god in case he sees me first , and avoids me . 
It is hard for a mortal man to defeat a god . �� / �She 
replied : �Stranger , I will tell you truthfully all you ask . 
When the sun is at the zenith , the wise 
Old man of the 
Sea emerges from the brine , masked by the dark wave , while the west wind blows . once risen , he lies down and sleeps in an echoing cave , and the seals , the daughter of the sea�s children , slithering from the grey water , lie down around him in a slumbering herd , breathing out the pungent odour of the deep . Choose three of your friends , the best you have in the oared ships , and at dawn I�ll lead you there and place you among their ranks . let me tell you the old sorcerer�s tricks . 
First he will go round counting the seals , and when he has looked them over , and tallied them in fives , he will lie down among them like a shepherd with his flock . 
When you see him settled , summon your strength and courage , and grasp him , however hard he struggles and tries to escape . 
Try he will , taking on the forms of everything on earth , of water and glorious blazing fire . but hold him bravely and grip him all the tighter . 
When he is finally willing to speak , and assumes the original shape in which you saw him resting , and questions you , then cease your violence , set the old man free , brave hero , and ask what god it is you have angered , and how you might return over the teeming waves . � / 
With that she plunged beneath the surge , and I went to where my ship lay on the shore , and my mind was filled with dark thoughts as I went . 
Then , when I had reached the ships and the waves , and we had prepared our supper , and deathless night descended , we lay down to sleep at the water�s edge . 
And as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , I walked along the shore of the wide seaway , praying devoutly to the gods : and three of my friends , on whom I 
could most rely , went with me . / 
She , meanwhile , plunging beneath the sea�s wide back , brought four sealskins up from the deep , freshly flayed , and plotted her father�s capture . 
She scooped out hiding places for us in the dunes , and sat there waiting : then , when we arrived , she made us lie in a row , and threw a seal skin over each . Our waiting would have been dreadful , so dreadful was the stench of the briny seals . 
Who would want to sleep with a beast from the sea ? but her gift saved us : she applied ambrosia to each man�s nostrils , and its sublime fragrance killed the stench . 
There we waited , patiently , all morning , and herds of seals came up from the sea . 
They lay down in rows along the beach , and at noon the old man emerged and found the sleek ranks . 
He looked them over , and tallied them , and not expecting our deceit , counted us among the first . 
Then he lay down to sleep . 
With a shout we rushed at him , and grappled him , but he forgot none of his crafty tricks . 
First he turned to a bearded lion , then a snake , and a leopard : then a giant boar : then he became rushing water , then a vast leafy tree : but we held tight with unyielding courage . 
When at last that old man , expert in magic arts , grew tired , he spoke to me , saying : �Son of 
Atreus , which of the gods 
told you to lie in wait for me , and hold me against my will ? 
What is it you wish ? �� / �At this , I answered : �Old man , why prevaricate , you know how long I have been penned in this isle , with no sign of an end to it , and how I lose heart . tell me , since you gods know everything , which of the immortals holds me here , hindering my passage , and tell me how to return over the teeming sea . � / 
He 
replied at once : �Surely you should have made rich sacrifice to 
Zeus and the other gods before you left , so as to return home faster , crossing the wine-dark sea . 
It is not your fate to reach your native land , and see your fine house and friends again , until you have sailed the waters of the 
Nile once more , 
Aegyptus , the heaven-fed river , and made holy offerings to the deathless gods who hold the wide heavens . 
Then , at last , the gods will let you return as you wish . � / At this my spirits fell , since he directed me to sail the long and weary way over the misty deep to 
Aegyptus . Even so I answered : �I will do all this , old man , as you suggest . but tell me this , in truth . have all the 
Achaeans whom 
Nestor and I left behind , as we sailed from 
Troy , reached home in safety with their ships ? or have any 
died a wretched death at sea , or in the arms of friends , though the war was over ? � / �Son of Atreus� , he 
replied swiftly , �why do you ask me this ? 
There is no benefit to you in knowing what I know , and when you have heard the truth , your tears will not be long in flowing . 
Many were killed , many were spared : yet only two of the bronze-clad 
Achaeans were lost on the homeward journey , and as for the fighting you were there . 
And a third I think is alive still , but a prisoner somewhere on the wide seas . / ajax the 
Lesser , first , was lost , with his long-oared ships . 
Poseidon wrecked him on the great cliffs of 
Gyrae , but rescued him from the waves . 
He would have avoided death , regardless of Athene�s hatred , if he had not boasted blindly . 
He claimed he had escaped the sea�s vast gulf despite the gods , and 
Poseidon heard his boast . 
Seizing his trident in his mighty hands the god struck the rock of 
Gyrae and split it apart . 
One part stood firm , but the shattered half , where ajax had crouched when his judgement was blinded , toppled into the sea , and drove him down into the vast surging tide . 
So he drank the salt waves , and 
died . �� / ��But your brother escaped that fate , and slipped by with his hollow ships , protected by lady 
Hera . 
Yet , as he neared the heights of cape Malea , a tempest caught him and drove him , groaning deeply , over the teeming waves , to the edge of that land where Thyestes once ruled , and at that time his son 
Aegisthus . but there the gods altered the wind�s course : a fair breeze blew and showed him the safe path home . 
Agamemnon was overjoyed to set foot again on his native soil , lying down he kissed the ground , and the tears streamed from his eyes , at the sight of his own land . 
Now a lookout saw him from the watchtower , a man appointed by cunning 
Aegisthus , who had promised him two golden talents . 
There he had watched for a year , fearful lest 
Agamemnon should pass unnoticed , and employ his strength in swift anger . 
He ran to the palace to carry his news to the usurper , and 
Aegisthus at once devised an ambush . 
He picked twenty of his best men , who lay in wait in the palace , while he ordered a feast prepared on the far side of the hall . 
Then , his mind plotting murder , he set out in his chariot to welcome 
Agamemnon , shepherd of the people , and drew him unsuspecting to his doom . 
When he had feasted him , he killed him , like an ox felled at the manger . 
And none of the followers of Atreus� son were spared , and none of Aegisthus� men , but all were killed in the palace . � / At this my heart was broken , and I fell to the sands and wept . I no longer wished to live , to see the sun . but when I was weary of weeping and clutching the ground , the wise 
Old man of the 
Sea said : �Son of 
Atreus , enough of this endless grieving that gains you nothing . Better to head for your native land as fast as you can , and you will either find 
Aegisthus still alive , or 
Orestes will have killed him ahead of you , and you can join the funeral rites . �� / �My spirits rose and my heart was comforted by this , despite my sorrow , and I spoke to him with winged words : �I k
now now about these two , but what of the third ? Name the man who still lives somewhere in the wide sea : or is he too dead ? 
Despite the pain , I wish to know . � / I spoke , and he at once 
replied , saying : �He is 
Odysseus , Laertes� son , whose home is on Ithaca . I saw him shedding great tears in the 
island haunt of the 
Nymph 
Calypso , who keeps him captive there , far from his native land , since he has no oared ship , no crew , to carry him over the wide waters . but because you are Helen�s husband , and therefore the son-in-law of 
Zeus , it is not ordained that you , 
Menelaus , favoured by 
Zeus , should meet your end in 
Argos , the horse-pasture . 
Instead the immortals will bear you to the 
Elysian Fields , at the world�s end , where yellow-haired 
Rhadamanthus dwells , and existence is best for men . 
There is no snow there , no rain , or fierce storms : rather 
Ocean brings singing breaths of the 
West 
Wind , to refresh them . � / 
With this , he sank into the billowing sea , and I returned to my ships with my brave friends , thinking dark thoughts as I went . 
Then , when I had reached the ships and the waves , and we had prepared our supper , and immortal night descended , we lay down to sleep at the water�s edge . 
And as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , we dragged our ships to the glittering water , and set up masts and sails in the trim craft , and the crews went to their oars , and sitting in rows struck the grey sea with their blades . 
So I sailed again to the heaven-fed waters of 
Nile , and moored the ships , and offered true sacrifice . 
Then , when I had appeased the wrath of the ever-living gods , I heaped up a mound to 
Agamemnon , so his fame might endure . 
When all was done I headed home , and the immortals sent me a following wind , and brought me quickly to my own beloved country . / but stay here in the palace , till the eleventh or the twelfth day , and I will send you off with honours , and fine gifts , a shining chariot with a trio of horses , and a glorious cup with which to pour libations to the deathless gods , while remembering me all your days . � / 
Then wise 
Telemachus 
replied : �Son of 
Atreus , do not delay me here . Truly I 
could be happy to stay a year in your palace , without desiring home or parents , so great is the pleasure I take listening to your speech , your tales . but my friends will be anxious in sacred 
Pylos while you detain me . if you make me a gift , let it be something precious . but I will not accept horses for 
Ithaca , I will leave them here for you to enjoy , since you are lord of a wide land , where lotus and sedge , and wheat and rye , and broad-eared white barley grow , while in Ithaca there are no broad plains or meadows at all . It is goat-pasture , though more varied than fields for horses . none of those islands that slope sheer to the sea are rich in meadows fit for herding them , Ithaca least of all . � / 
So saying , 
Menelaus of the loud war cry smiled , and patted him with his hand , and answered : �Dear boy , you are of noble blood , to speak so . 
Well , I will alter the gifts , as I may . I will give you one of the richest and loveliest treasures of my house , a finely fashioned mixing bowl . 
It is solid silver with a rim of gold , the work of 
Hephaestus himself . 
Phaedimus , the hero , 
King of 
Sidon , made me a present of it , when his house gave me shelter on my way home , and 
now I wish to present it to you . � / 
While 
they conversed , the guests were arriving at the sacred king�s palace . 
They drove in their sheep , and brought unmixed wine , and their elegantly veiled wives sent bread . 
So 
they prepared the feast in the hall . / but in front of Odysseus� palace the 
Suitors , insolent as ever , were amusing themselves hurling the discus and javelin across the level space . 
Antinous and noble 
Eurymachus , their leaders , were there , the most able of them all . 
Noemon , Phronius� son , approached with a question for 
Antinous : / �Do we know or not when 
Telemachus is due back from sandy 
Pylos ? 
He has taken a ship of mine , and gone , and I need her to cross to the wide plains of 
Elis , where I have twelve brood mares , and sturdy mules that are not yet weaned or broken . I need to cut one out , and train him . � / 
They were amazed at this , not thinking 
Telemachus had gone to 
Neleian 
Pylos , but that he was in the field , among the flocks perhaps , or with the swineherd . / 
Then 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , said : �Tell me the truth 
now , when did he go , and who went with him ? 
Were 
they picked men of Ithaca , or slaves and servants of his own ? 
He might have so decided . 
And tell me so as to convince me . 
Did he take the black ship from you against your will , or did you agree willingly when he asked you ? � / �I gave it him freely . � said 
Noemon , �What else can one do when a man like him , burdened with care , makes a request ? 
It would be hard to refuse the gift . 
And the best of the island�s young men , next to us , went with him . I saw mentor take command of them on board , or a god perhaps who looked like mentor . I wonder at it , since I saw noble mentor here , yesterday , at dawn : yet earlier he had embarked for 
Pylos . � / 
With that 
Noemon left for his father�s house , leaving the two proud lords enraged . 
They insisted the 
Suitors leave their games , at once , and sit down together , while 
Antinous , Eupeithes� son , vented his anger . His dark spirit was filled with fury , and his eyes blazed with fire . / �Well 
now , 
Telemachus has carried this out , insolently indeed , a journey we thought he would never manage . 
The lad went swiftly , in spite of us , and launched his ship , with a hand picked crew . Given time he will start to cause us problems : may 
Zeus humble him though , and destroy him before he reaches manhood . but come , grant me a fast ship and a crew of twenty , and I�ll lie in wait for him in the straits as he makes his solitary passage between Ithaca and rocky 
Samos , and his voyage in search of his father will end sadly . � / 
They praised his speech , and seconded his plan . 
Then 
they quickly rose and went off towards Odysseus� palace . / 
Now 
Penelope was not long in ignorance of what the 
Suitors were secretly plotting , for 
Medon , the herald 
told her , having heard their plans as he stood outside the court where 
they were weaving their mischief . 
He set off through the palace , to carry the news to 
Penelope , and she spoke to him as he crossed her threshold : / �Why have the noble 
Suitors sent you , 
Herald ? 
Is it to tell divine Odysseus� maids to forgo their tasks , and prepare them a feast ? 
May this be their latest feast and their last , so 
they will never woo or gather anywhere else again . 
They are always crowding in here , wasting our stores , and wise Telemachus� inheritance . 
They 
could never have listened when 
they were children , and their fathers talked of how 
Odysseus treated them , never unjust to any man in word or action , as sacred kings often are : disliking one man , while favouring another . 
He never dealt unfairly with anyone . but their thoughts and shameful actions are evident , and gratitude for past goodness is 
now forgotten . � / 
Then thoughtful 
Medon 
replied : �My 
Queen , I wish that was the worst of it . but the 
Suitors are planning a greater evil , one I pray the son of 
Cronos may never allow . 
They plan to put 
Telemachus to the sword as he returns from his journey to sacred 
Pylos and noble 
Lacadaemon , seeking news of his father . � / At this her knee-joints slackened , and her heart melted . for a while she 
could not speak : her eyes filled with tears , her voice was stilled . At last she 
could reply : �Why did my son go there , 
Herald ? 
He had no need to sail the swift ships , those chariots of the deep , and cross the wide ocean waves . 
Is not even his name to be left among men ? � / 
Thoughtful 
Medon answered her : �I do not know whether a god drove him , or whether his own heart sent him to 
Pylos to learn of his father�s death or return . � 
So saying he walked off through Odysseus� palace , while a cloud of all-consuming anxiety cloaked her , such that she had no strength to seat herself on one of the many chairs in the room , but sank down on the threshold of her well-made chamber , grieving pitifully , while all the maids of the household , young and old , wept around her . / 
Sobbing with grief , 
Penelope spoke to them : �Listen , my friends , for 
Zeus has charged me with sorrow beyond all the women of my generation . long ago I lost my great and glorious , lion-hearted husband , first among the 
Danaans in every virtue , whose fame resounds through Hellas to the heart of 
Argos . 
Now the storm wind has swept my beloved son from our door without trace , and I never even knew he had gone . cruel ones ! none of you thought to wake me from sleep , though you must have known he was boarding his hollow black ship ! if I had known he planned this voyage , every means would have been used to keep him here , however ready he was to be off , or he would have left me here dead . 
So 
now one of you run and call old 
Dolius , my servant . 
My father offered his service to me , when I came here , and he tends my well-stocked orchard . 
He can go and sit with 
Laertes , and tell him of this . Perhaps 
Laertes may think of some scheme , and show himself to the people , and beg them with tears not to destroy his and Odysseus� sacred line . � / 
Then 
Eurycleia , the loyal nurse , 
replied : �Odysseus� bride , dear lady , whether you let me live on in this house , or kill me with a pitiless knife , I cannot hide the truth from you . I knew all , and I gave him whatever he asked for , bread and pure wine . but he made me swear solemnly not to tell you , till eleven or twelve days hence , or till you missed him and heard he was gone , so as not to spoil your beauty with weeping . Go and bathe , and dress in fresh clothes , then go to your high chamber with your maids , and pray to 
Athene , daughter of 
Zeus , who wears the aegis : even 
now she may save your son from death . 
And don�t add to the old man�s troubles , since I hardly think the blessed gods hate the sons of Arceisius� line , and 
they will surely leave one to rule the vaulted halls , and all the rich far-flung land . � / 
So speaking , she 
soothed Penelope�s grief , and stemmed her tears . 
And the 
Queen bathed , and dressed in fresh clothes , and went to her high chamber with her maids , and filling a basket with barley grains she prayed to 
Athene . �Hear me , Atrytone , daughter of aegis-bearing 
Zeus ! if ever resourceful 
Odysseus burnt the fat thigh joints of ewe or heifer here in his palace for you , remember it 
now , I beg , and rescue my dear son , and prevent the 
Suitors in their insolent wickedness from harming him . � / 
She cried it aloud , and the goddess heard her prayer , but the 
Suitors caused uproar in the shadowy halls , and one of the arrogant youths called out : �The much-courted 
Queen is surely preparing herself for marriage , without knowing the death that awaits her son . � 
So he spoke , yet none of them foresaw the outcome . 
Then 
Antinous addressed them : �What possesses you ? 
Avoid these boastful words , lest your speech is reported elsewhere in the palace . rise silently , and execute the plan we all agreed on . � / 
He chose the twenty best men and 
they went down to the shore and a swift vessel . 
They drew it out into deep water , set up the mast and sails in that black ship , fixed the oars in their leather straps , in their rows , and raised the white sail . noble squires brought them their weapons . 
Then 
they moored the vessel well out in the channel , and returned on shore . 
There 
they ate supper and waited for evening . / but wise 
Penelope lay in her high chamber , without touching food , tasting neither meat nor drink , wondering whether her faultless son would escape death , or be killed by the insolent 
Suitors . 
Like a lioness , seized by fear , troubled by the tightening ring of cunning men around her , so she was troubled till sweet slumber captured her . 
She sank back , as all her limbs relaxed , and fell asleep . / 
Then the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had an idea . 
She created a phantom , in the likeness of Penelope�s sister , 
Iphthime , that other daughter of great-hearted 
Icarius . Eumelus had married her , and she was living at 
Pherae . 
Athene sent the phantom to noble Odysseus� palace , to the weeping , grieving 
Penelope , to tell her to stop her crying , her tear-filled lament . 
It entered her room past the strap of the bolt , stood by her head , and spoke to her : �Anxious 
Penelope , are you asleep ? 
The gods , themselves untroubled , do not wish you to weep with distress , since your son will return : in their eyes he has done no wrong . � / 
Wise 
Penelope answered her from her sweet sleep at the 
Gate of 
Dreams : �Sister , why are you here ? 
You are not used to visiting us , living so far away . do you tell me to dry my tears , and forget the pain in my mind and heart ? long ago I lost my great and glorious , lion-hearted husband , first among the 
Danaans in every virtue , whose fame resounds through Hellas to the heart of 
Argos . 
Now my beloved son , a mere child , untried in action and debate , has left in a hollow ship . I grieve for him more than the other , and tremble with fear lest anything harms him in the land he travels to or at sea . 
So many enemies plot against him , eager to kill him as he returns to his native isle . � / 
The shadowy phantom 
replied : �Be brave and do not fear overmuch , since he is guided by one whose power men pray to have at their side : it is 
Pallas 
Athene herself , who pities you in your grief , and has sent me with this message . � / 
Then wise 
Penelope answered once more : �If you are truly divine , and have heard her divine voice , tell me also whether his father , that man of sorrows , is still alive and sees the sun , or is dead in the house of Hades . � / but the shadowy phantom said to her : �No , I will speak no word of him , alive or dead : it is wrong to utter words idle as the wind . � 
With this , it slipped away past the bolt , into the breeze . 
And Icarius� daughter woke from sleep with a start , her heart comforted by the bright vision that had come to her in the dark of night . / 
The 
Suitors though had embarked , and were sailing the paths of the sea , intending secretly to murder 
Telemachus . in the open sea , midway between Ithaca and rugged 
Samos , there is a rocky islet , 
Asteris , where , despite its size , lies a good harbour with twin entrances . 
And there the 
Achaeans waited in ambush for 
Telemachus . /
