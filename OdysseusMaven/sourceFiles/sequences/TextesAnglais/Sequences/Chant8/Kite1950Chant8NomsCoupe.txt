as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , royal 
Alcinous left his bed , and so did 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , sacker of cities . 
Then royal 
Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacians� gathering place , laid out there by the ships . 
There 
they sat on the polished seats next to each other , and 
Pallas 
Athene , planning great-hearted Odysseus� return , traversed the 
city , disguised as wise Alcinous� 
herald . She approached the nobles , and spoke these words : �Leaders and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , come with me to the assembly , and hear of the stranger , driven to wander the sea , who has come to wise Alcinous� palace , a man like the immortals . � / 
With her words she roused their hearts and minds , and the gathering place was quickly filled with those arriving . 
Many wondered at the sight of Laertes� wise son . 
Athene invested his head and shoulders with grace , and made him taller and stronger , so that the 
Phaeacians would all welcome him with awe and respect , and he might perform the many tasks with which 
they might test him . 
When 
they were all together in the assembly 
Alcinous addressed them : / �Leader and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , listen while I speak as my feelings prompt me . This stranger , whose name I do not know , has come to my house in his travels from east or west . 
He asks for his passage home , and seeks our confirmation . let us further his going , as with others in the past . for no one who comes to my house waits here long , grieving for lack of help . 
So , let us run a black ship down to the glittering waves for her maiden voyage , and choose fifty-two young men from the town , who have proved themselves before . 
And when 
they have duly lashed the oars in place , come ashore quickly to my house and ready a feast : I will provide enough for all . 
These are my orders for the crew , and you sceptered princes come on now to the fair palace , and let us entertain the stranger there : let no one refuse . 
And summon , 
Demodocus , the divine bard , for a god has given him supreme powers of song , to give delight , in whatever form his spirit prompts him to sing . � / 
With this he led the way , and the sceptered princes followed , while a 
herald went to bring the divine bard . 
And the chosen fifty-two went , as ordered , to the shore of the barren sea . 
And when 
they had reached the ship and the shore , 
they drew the black vessel down to the deep water , and set up mast and sail in her , and fitted the rows of oars through their leather straps , and raised the white sail . 
They moored her well out in the roads , then made their way to shore and the great palace of wise 
Alcinous . 
The courts and halls and porticoes were full of the gathering , a crowd of young men and old . 
Alcinous had twelve sheep slaughtered for them , eight white-tusked boars , and two shambling oxen . 
They flayed the carcasses , dressed them , and prepared a tempting feast . / 
The 
herald 
returned , leading their skilful bard , whom the muse loved more than other men , though she gave him both good and evil : she robbed him of his sight , but gifted him the power of sweet song . Pontonous , the 
herald , placed a silver-embossed chair in the midst of them all , with its back against a high pillar , and hung the ringing lyre on a peg above his head , and showed him how to find it with his hands . 
And he set a handsome table by his side , with a basket of bread , and a cup of wine to drink if he was so minded . 
Then 
they all stretched out their hands to the fine feast spread before them . / 
When 
they had satisfied their need for food and drink , the muse inspired her bard to sing of the heroes� glorious deeds , part of that tale whose fame had risen to high heaven , the quarrel between 
Achilles , Peleus� son , and 
Odysseus , who argued fiercely at the gods� rich festival , though 
Agamemnon , king of men , was secretly pleased to see a dispute between the Achaeans� finest . for 
Phoebus 
Apollo had prophesied , at sacred 
Pytho , where 
Agamemnon had crossed the stone threshold to consult the oracle , that after a quarrel sorrow would begin to overtake the 
Trojans , though by Zeus� will it was the beginning of sorrow for the 
Greeks as well . This was the bard�s song , and 
Odysseus clutched at his long purple cloak with his great hands , and dragged it over his head to hide his handsome face , ashamed lest the 
Phaeacians see the tears pouring from his eyes . 
Whenever the divine bard stopped singing , 
Odysseus wiped the tears away , drew the cloak from his head , and reaching for his two-handled cup made libations to the gods . but when the bard began again , prompted by the 
Phaeacian lords who enjoyed his song , 
Odysseus covered his head once more and groaned . / 
He hid the falling tears from all except 
Alcinous , who , aware because he sat by him , noticed all , and heard him sighing deeply . 
And he spoke , quickly , to the sea-faring 
Phaeacians : �Leaders and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , hear me . 
We have enjoyed sharing our rich feast and the music of the lyre , its companion . 
Now let us go outside and 
try our skill in various sports , so this stranger when he is home can tell his friends how much better we are than other men in boxing , wrestling , running , and leaping . � / 
With this he led the way and all followed . 
The 
herald hung the ringing lyre on the peg , and led 
Demodocus by the hand from the hall along the same path the 
Phaeacian nobles had taken to see the games . 
They headed for the gathering place , and a countless throng went with them . 
Many fine young men rose to compete : 
Acroneos and 
Ocyalus , 
Elatreus , 
Nauteus , 
Prymneus , 
Anchialus and Eretmeus , 
Ponteus and Proreus , 
Thoon , 
Anabesineos , and 
Amphialus , son of 
Polyneus , Tecton�s son . 
Euryalus too , the equal of ares , destroyer of men , and son of Naubolus who in looks and form was the finest of all the 
Phaeacians after peerless 
Laodamas . 
And flawless Alcinous� three sons as well , 
Laodamas , 
Halius and godlike 
Clytoneus . / 
The first trial was a foot race : 
they all sped from the mark along the course set out , raising the dust from the ground . 
Faultless 
Clytoneus was quickest , and taking the lead he reached the crowd , leaving the rest behind by as much as a furrow�s length in mule-ploughed land . 
Then 
they tested each other in painful bouts of wrestling , where 
Euryalus beat the best . 
Amphialus then leapt furthest , while 
Elatreus conquered with the discus , and 
Laodamas , Alcinous� fine son , won in the boxing . 
When 
they were all satisfied with the contest , 
Laodamas , said : �Friends , let�s ask the stranger whether he�s practised in any familiar sport . He�s a fine build in thighs and calves , with two strong arms , a stout neck , plenty of strength . Nor has he lost the power of youth , he is only wearied with suffering . There�s nothing like the sea to sap a man�s strength , however tough he might be . � / 
Euryalus 
replied : �Laodamas , what you say is right . Go and challenge him yourself , and make the challenge a public one . � / 
At this Alcinous� fine son came to the centre , and spoke to 
Odysseus : �Sir stranger , come , enter the contest too , if you have any skill as seems likely , since there is no greater glory for a living man than that which he wins with his own hands and feet . 
Come , prove yourself , and throw off your cares . 
Your journey will soon start . 
The ship is launched now and the crew are ready . � / �Laodamas� 
replied resourceful 
Odysseus , �why provoke me with a challenge ? 
My mind is on trouble not on play , since I have toiled and suffered greatly in the past , and now I long only to return home , and so I sit in your gathering and plead with your king and people . � / 
Euryalus answered then , mocking him to his face : �Indeed , stranger , you look like a man unused to manly sports , more like the captain of a merchant crew , trading to and fro in a sailing ship , careful for his cargo , keeping a greedy eye on freight and profit . 
You are no athlete . � / 
With a dark look , resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �Stranger , you speak unwisely , you are a man blinded by foolishness . How true it is that the gods seldom grace men equally with their gifts , of mind , form or speech . One man is meagre in appearance , but the gods crown his words with beauty , and men delight in him as he speaks sweetly in modest eloquence , conspicuous in a crowd , and looked on like a god as he crosses the 
city . Another seems an immortal , but his words lack grace . 
You too have exceptional looks a god could not better yet your mind is crippled . 
You have roused my spirit by speaking rudely . I am no novice in your sports : indeed I was one of the best when I had my youth , and strength lay in my hands . 
While now I�m constrained by pain and suffering , since I have endured many things in my passage through mortal warfare and hostile seas . 
And yet , though I�ve suffered deeply , I will join your contest , since your speech has stung me , and your words have riled me to the heart . � / 
With this he leapt to his feet , still wrapped in his cloak , and seized a discus bigger than the rest , thicker and heavier by some way than those the 
Phaeacians normally used in competition . Spinning around , he sent it from his huge hand , and it hummed as it flew : the 
Phaeacians cowered , those lords of the ship and the long oar , beneath the flying stone . Flung smoothly from the hand , it sailed past all their marks , and 
Athene , in human likeness , pegged the distance , then , spoke to him : �Stranger , even a blind man , groping with his hands , could find your mark , by far and away the furthest , and separate from the cluster . 
You can take heart from this , at any rate : none of the 
Phaeacians will meet or pass it . � / noble and long-suffering 
Odysseus was pleased by her words , happy to find a genuine supporter at the games . 
He spoke to the 
Phaeacians now with a lighter heart . / �Match that , you youngsters : I expect I�ll send another along , as far or further , in a moment . as for the rest , since you�ve angered me deeply , if anyone has the courage and the spirit , let him come and prove himself , in boxing , wrestling , running , it matters not : let any of you 
Phaeacians 
try , except 
Laodamas . for he�s my host , and who would quarrel with the one who shows him hospitality ? 
Only a worthless idiot would challenge the man who welcomes him to a foreign land . 
He would ruin his own good luck . but the rest of you I�ll not deny or disdain , wishing to know your skill and be matched with you . I am no lightweight in any of the sports men practice . I know how to handle a polished bow with skill , and I was always first to pick off a man in the enemy ranks , however many comrades stood with me to shoot at the foe . 
When we 
Achaeans fought at 
Troy only 
Philoctetes surpassed me . but I count myself the best by far of all the other mortal men on earth , who eat their bread . 
Still , I would not claim to compete with hercules , or 
Oechalian 
Eurytus , archers who vied with the gods . That�s why great 
Eurytus died swiftly , and never reached old age in his halls , because 
Apollo , challenged to an archery contest , killed him in anger . 
And the spear I hurl further than others can shoot an arrow . 
Only in running I fear one of you 
Phaeacians might best me , since I�ve been thrown about by the waves , and on my raft I could not exercise , and my legs are weakened . � / 
They all stood silent at his words . 
Only 
Alcinous answered , saying : 
Stranger , since you are not ungracious , but wish to emphasise the skills you possess , and were angered because this man taunted you at the games , making light of your powers , in a way that none would who rightly knew how to speak ; come , listen to what I say . 
Then you may recount it to some other hero , as you feast in your home with your wife and children , remembering our skill , the talents 
Zeus endowed us with from our forefather�s days . 
We may not be the greatest boxers or wrestlers , but we run fast in the race , and we are the finest sailors : and ever the feast is dear to us , the dancing and the lyre , fresh clothes , warm baths , and bed . / 
So come , you finest dancers among us 
Phaeacians , perform for this stranger , so he can tell his friends when he reaches home how we excel not only in swiftness of foot , and seamanship , but in dancing too , and in song . let someone go quickly , and fetch 
Demodocus his ringing lyre that is somewhere in the palace . � / 
The 
herald rose at godlike Alcinous� words and brought the hollow lyre from the king�s hall . 
Then nine elected officials , who organised the games , cleared a space , and marked out a wide arena for the dance . 
Next , the 
herald came forward carrying Demodocus� ringing lyre . 
The bard stood in the centre and round him a group of dancers , boys in the first flush of youth , skilled in dancing , and 
Odysseus marvelled as he gazed at their flashing feet , striking the sacred dancing floor . / 
Then the bard struck the chords that began his sweet song , and told of the love of ares and 
Aphrodite of the lovely crown , how 
they lay together in secret in Hephaestus� house , and how ares gave her a host of gifts while dishonouring the lord Hephaestus� bed . but 
Helios , the sun god , who had spied them sleeping together , came to tell him . 
When 
Hephaestus had heard the sour tale , he went to his smithy his heart set on evil , and set up his huge anvil on its block , and forged a net of chains , firm and unbreakable . 
And when , furious with ares , he had made the snare , he went to his room and marriage bed , and fastened the netting to its posts , and hung its links above from the roof beams , fine as a spider�s web , and so cunningly made it was invisible even to the blessed gods . / 
When he had spread his net over the bed , he pretended to leave for 
Lemnos , that well-ordered citadel , dearest of all the islands , to his eyes . Nor was ares of the golden reins blind to the master-craftsman Hephaestus� going , but went straight to his house , hot for the love of 
Cytherea of the lovely crown . She had scarcely left her father�s presence , that of 
mighty Cronos� son , and seated herself on arriving , when ares entered and took her hand and spoke to her : �Sweetheart , come , let us to bed , and take delight in mutual love . 
Hephaestus has left , for 
Lemnos no doubt , to visit the barbarously spoken 
Sintians . � / as he spoke it seemed a pleasant thing to her to lie with him . 
So 
they went to the bed and lay down . 
Then clever Hephaestus� cunning net fell all around them , and 
they were unable to move or raise themselves . 
They soon realised there was no escape . 
Now the great lame god approached , for 
Helios had kept watch and carried the word , and 
Hephaestus 
returned before ever reaching 
Lemnos . 
He came home , troubled in mind , and as he stood in the gateway a terrible anger seized him . 
And he cried out fiercely to all the gods : / �Father 
Zeus , and all you other blessed and immortal gods , come , see something laughable , and intolerable , how 
Aphrodite , daughter of 
Zeus , scorning me for my lameness , makes love with hateful ares because he is straight-limbed and handsome while I was born crooked . 
My parents alone are to blame for that : I wish 
they had never made me ! look how these two usurp my bed and sleep together , while I am filled with pain to see it . 
Yet 
they won�t want to lie like this much longer , I think : no , not for an instant , however much 
they are in love . They�ll soon lose their urge for bed , the net and its links will hold them instead till her father repays me all the gifts I gave him while wooing this shameless hussy , a beautiful daughter indeed but faithless . � / 
At this the gods came crowding the bronze threshold : 
Poseidon , 
Earth-Bearer , 
Hermes the messenger , and lord 
Apollo who strikes from afar . 
The goddesses stayed at home from modesty , but those deathless ones , givers of good , stood in the entrance , and when 
they saw clever Hephaestus� snare , unquenchable laughter flowed from the blessed gods . One would glance at his neighbour and say : �Ill deeds don�t prosper . 
The slow catch the swift , as 
Hephaestus here , slow as he is , has netted ares the swiftest of all the 
Olympian gods . 
He has trapped him by cunning , though lame . ares must pay the fine for adultery . � / 
Such were the comments , then lord 
Apollo , son of 
Zeus , said to 
Hermes : �Guide and 
Giver of 
Good 
Things , 
Hermes , Zeus� son , would you not care to lie in bed beside golden 
Aphrodite , even though you were snared by unbreakable chains ? � / 
The 
Messenger-God , 
Slayer of argus , 
replied : �Lord 
Apollo , 
Far-Shooter , three times as many inescapable links could hold me , and you gods could be watching , and yes , all the goddesses too , if only I might sleep with golden 
Aphrodite . � / 
At this , laughter rose from the group of immortal gods . but 
Poseidon was unsmiling , and kept begging 
Hephaestus , the master craftsman , to set ares free , speaking with winged words : �Set him free , and I promise what you ask , that he�ll pay what�s owed in the presence of the deathless gods . � / 
The illustrious lame god 
replied : �Poseidon , 
Earth-Bearer , don�t ask this of me . It�s a sad mistake for sure , to stand surety for a sad rogue . 
Will I bind you with chains , in the presence of the deathless gods , if ares shrugs off both chains and debt , and escapes ? � / but 
Poseidon , said again : �If ares shrugs off the debt and escapes , 
Hephaestus , I will pay it myself . � / To this , the illustrious lame god 
replied : �Well , I can�t refuse you , it wouldn�t be right . � 
And he loosed the net , and the two of them , free of the chains , leaped up in a trice and fled . ares headed for 
Thrace , but laughter-loving 
Aphrodite to Paphos in Cyprus , where she has a sanctuary and fragrant altar . 
There the Graces bathed her , and anointed her with such heavenly oil as gleams on the limbs of the gods who live forever . 
And 
they dressed her in beautiful clothes , marvellous to behold . This was the song of the famous bard , that delighted 
Odysseus and the 
Phaeacians famed for their long-oared ships . 
Next 
Alcinous asked 
Halius and 
Laodamas to dance by themselves , since no one else could compete with them . 
Having taken a lovely purple ball , which clever Polybus had made , one leant back and threw it high towards the shadowy clouds , while the other leapt and caught it again before his feet touched the ground . 
When 
they had repeatedly shown their skill at hurling it high , 
they threw it to and fro as 
they danced on the rich earth , while the other youths stood round the arena beating time amidst loud applause . / 
Then noble 
Odysseus spoke : �Lord 
Alcinous , most renowned of men , you claimed your dancers were best , and see , your word is good : I�m amazed at the sight . � / royal 
Alcinous was delighted at this and at once he spoke to the seafaring 
Phaeacians : / �Leaders and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , hear me . This stranger seems a man of the highest discernment . Let�s give him a friendly gift as is only right . Twelve illustrious princes rule our land , and I am the thirteenth . let each of you twelve bring him a fresh tunic and cloak , and a talent of rich gold , and let us all arrange it swiftly , so the stranger may go to his supper with a happy heart having our gifts to hand . 
And let 
Euryalus make amends with a gift and an apology , for his unfortunate words . � / 
They praised his speech , and endorsed his thought , and each sent a squire to fetch the gifts . 
Then it came to 
Euryalus to reply , saying : �Lord 
Alcinous , most renowned of men , I will make amends as you command . I will give him this bronze sword with a silver hilt , and a scabbard for it of fresh-cut ivory : it will be of great value to him . � / 
With this he placed the silver-embossed sword in 
Odysseus hands , and spoke to him winged words : �Sir stranger , I salute you , and if harsh words have been said , may the storm winds take them and blow them away . as for yourself may the gods grant you see your wife once more , and your native land , since you�ve suffered endless trouble , far from your friends . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �I salute you , too , my friend , and may the gods give you joy , and may you never have cause to miss the sword you give me with these words , which indeed make amends . � 
So saying he hung the silver-embossed sword from his shoulder . as the sun set the splendid gifts arrived . 
The noble squires carried these to Alcinous� palace . 
There , the sons of faultless 
Alcinous took them and placed them before their beloved mother . 
And royal 
Alcinous leading the way 
they all entered and sat on raised seats . 
Then 
mighty 
Alcinous said to 
Arete : �Wife , have a fine coffer , the best you have , brought here , and place a fresh tunic and cloak in it yourself , and heat a cauldron of water over the fire , so that when he has bathed , and seen stored away all these gifts the noble 
Phaeacians have brought , he can take pleasure in the feast and the singing . 
And I will give him this fine gold cup , so he may remember me forever when he pours libations , at home , to 
Zeus and the other gods . � / 
At this , 
Arete ordered her maids to place a large cauldron on the fire , for the bathwater . 
They filled it then piled firewood underneath . Flames licked around the cauldron�s belly , and the water was heated . 
Meanwhile 
Arete had a strong coffer from the treasure chamber brought for the stranger , and filled it with the Phaeacians� fine gifts of clothes and gold . She added a lovely tunic and cloak herself then spoke to 
Odysseus winged words : �See to its lid , and knot the cord yourself , now , lest someone rob you on the journey as you lie in sweet sleep aboard the black ship . � / 
Attending to her words , noble long-suffering 
Odysseus quickly closed the lid , and tied its cords with a subtle knot that lady Circe had taught him . 
Then the housekeeper invited him to take his bath , and the sight of it delighted him , since comforts like these had been scarce once he�d left the home of 
Calypso of the lovely tresses , where he�d been cared for like a god . 
When the maids had bathed him , and rubbed him with oil , and had clothed him in a fine tunic and cloak , he left the bath and joined the men at their wine . / 
Nausicaa , graced by the gods with beauty , was standing by a door-post of the well-built hall , and when her eyes fell on him she marvelled , and she spoke to him with winged words : �Joy to you , stranger , and may you remember me sometimes even in your own country , since you owe your life indeed to me . � / 
And resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied , saying : �Nausicaa , daughter of brave 
Alcinous , by this token may 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , Hera�s husband , grant me my homecoming , and may I see that day . 
Then I will pray to you there too , as a divinity , all my days , since you , girl , have given me life . � / 
With that he seated himself next to 
King 
Alcinous , since 
they were already serving the food and mixing the wine . 
Then the 
herald approached leading good 
Demodocus the bard , whom all honoured , and seated him in the midst of the throng , on a chair that leant against a tall pillar . 
Resourceful 
Odysseus , first cutting slices from the chine of a white-tusked boar rich with fat on either side , of which there was plenty left , spoke to the 
herald : �Take this portion of food to 
Demodocus , 
Herald , and let me welcome him , despite my grief . Bards are honoured and revered by every man on earth , for the muse has shown them the path to poetry , and loves the tribe of poets . � / 
He finished , and the 
herald took the food and handed it to noble 
Demodocus , who was delighted . 
So 
they stretched out their hands to the good things before them , and when 
they had sated their desire for food and drink , resourceful 
Odysseus spoke to the bard , saying : �Demodocus , I praise you above all mortal men , one taught by the muse , Zeus� daughter , or perhaps by 
Apollo , for you sang the Achaeans� fate with truth and feeling , all of their actions and their suffering , all the efforts 
they exerted , as if you had been there , or heard it from one who was . 
Now , come , change your theme , and sing of the making of the 
Wooden 
Horse , that 
Epeius fashioned with Athene�s help , that noble 
Odysseus contrived to have dragged inside the citadel , filled by cunning with warriors who then sacked 
Troy . tell the tale as it happened , and I will say to all mankind that the god has given you freely of the power of divine song . � / 
At his words the bard , inspired by the god , began , and raising his voice picked up the tale at the point where the 
Argives had burned their camp , boarded their oared ships , and sailed some way off , leaving glorious 
Odysseus and the rest sitting inside the 
Horse , at the Trojan�s meeting place . 
The 
Trojans themselves had dragged it into the citadel . 
There it stood , while the people sat round it , discussing it endlessly to no conclusion . Three suggestions found favour : to cut through the hollow timber with pitiless bronze , or drag it to the edge of the rock and over the cliff , or let it stand there , as a grand offering to the gods , in propitiation , which is what happened in the end . for it was their destiny to be destroyed when the 
city accepted that huge horse of wood , where the best of the 
Argives lay hidden , bringing death and ruin to 
Troy . / 
Then he sang how the 
Achaeans left their hollow hiding place , and poured from the horse , to sack the 
city . 
He sang how the other warriors dispersing through the streets , laid waste high 
Troy , but 
Odysseus , the image of ares , together with godlike 
Menelaus , sought Deiphobus� house . 
There , said the tale , 
Odysseus fought the most terrible of fights , but conquered in the end , with the help of great-hearted 
Athene . / 
So sang the famous bard . 
And Odysseus� heart melted , and tears poured from his eyes . 
He wept pitifully , as a woman weeps who throws herself on her husband�s dying body , fallen in front of his 
city and people , trying to ward off that evil moment from the 
city and his own children : watching him gasping for breath in dying , she clings to him and screams aloud , while behind her the enemy beat her back and shoulders with their spears : then she is led into captivity to endure a life of toil and suffering , her cheeks wasted pitifully with grief . 
He hid the falling tears from all except 
Alcinous , who , aware because he sat by him , noticed all , and heard him sighing deeply . 
At one he addressed the sea-faring 
Phaeacians : / �Leaders and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , hear me , and let 
Demodocus still his ringing lyre , since his song fails to give pleasure to all alike . 
From the moment of our feast when our divine bard was inspired to sing , this stranger has never stopped his sad grieving , his heart must surely be overflowing with sorrow . let the bard refrain , and let us enjoy ourselves , hosts and guest alike : that would be better . 
We prepared all this for the sake of a sacred stranger after all , this farewell and the gifts of friendship we give with love . To a man of any intelligence , a stranger , a suppliant , is dear as a brother . / 
Now , sir , for your part : don�t mask the answer to what I ask with clever subterfuge : plain speaking serves us best . tell us the name you go by at home , the name your mother and father , and the rest , in the town and countryside , give you . No one who�s born into this world , whether high or low , goes nameless : our parents give us all a name once we are born . Name your country , your people and your 
city , so our ships may take you home , steering a course by means of their own intelligence . 
Phaeacian ships have no helmsman or steering oar , for the ships themselves know our thoughts and wishes , and the cities of men , every fertile country , and hidden by mist and cloud 
they speed over the sea�s wide gulf , and never fear damage or shipwreck . Though I heard a story once from my father 
Nausithous , who used to say that 
Poseidon was angry with us because we conveyed all men , in safety . 
He claimed that some day , when a well-built 
Phaeacian ship was crossing the misty sea , returning from such a journey , 
Poseidon would strike her , and then ring our 
city with a mountain chain . 
That is what the old king claimed , and the god can do it , or leave it undone , as he wishes . / but tell me this , and speak true , where have your wanderings taken you , what countries of men have you seen ? tell me of those peoples , and their crowded cities , the cruel , savage and lawless races , and those who are good to strangers , and in their hearts fear the gods . 
And tell me why you weep , and sorrow in spirit , when you hear of the Argives� fate , of 
Troy and the 
Danaans . 
The gods engineered it , weaving the web of mortal ruin , to make a song for those as yet unborn . Perhaps some kinsman died at 
Troy , some good and loyal man , your son-in-law or your wife�s father , dearest to a man after his own flesh and blood . or a sure friend , for such is as good as a brother . � / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , royal 
Alcinous left his bed , and so did 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , sacker of cities . 
Then royal 
Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacians� gathering place , laid out there by the ships . 
There 
they sat on the polished seats next to each other , and 
Pallas 
Athene , planning great-hearted Odysseus� return , traversed the 
city , disguised as wise Alcinous� 
herald . She approached the nobles , and spoke these words : �Leaders and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , come with me to the assembly , and hear of the stranger , driven to wander the sea , who has come to wise Alcinous� palace , a man like the immortals . � / 
With her words she roused their hearts and minds , and the gathering place was quickly filled with those arriving . 
Many wondered at the sight of Laertes� wise son . 
Athene invested his head and shoulders with grace , and made him taller and stronger , so that the 
Phaeacians would all welcome him with awe and respect , and he might perform the many tasks with which 
they might test him . 
When 
they were all together in the assembly 
Alcinous addressed them : / �Leader and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , listen while I speak as my feelings prompt me . This stranger , whose name I do not know , has come to my house in his travels from east or west . 
He asks for his passage home , and seeks our confirmation . let us further his going , as with others in the past . for no one who comes to my house waits here long , grieving for lack of help . 
So , let us run a black ship down to the glittering waves for her maiden voyage , and choose fifty-two young men from the town , who have proved themselves before . 
And when 
they have duly lashed the oars in place , come ashore quickly to my house and ready a feast : I will provide enough for all . 
These are my orders for the crew , and you sceptered princes come on now to the fair palace , and let us entertain the stranger there : let no one refuse . 
And summon , 
Demodocus , the divine bard , for a god has given him supreme powers of song , to give delight , in whatever form his spirit prompts him to sing . � / 
With this he led the way , and the sceptered princes followed , while a 
herald went to bring the divine bard . 
And the chosen fifty-two went , as ordered , to the shore of the barren sea . 
And when 
they had reached the ship and the shore , 
they drew the black vessel down to the deep water , and set up mast and sail in her , and fitted the rows of oars through their leather straps , and raised the white sail . 
They moored her well out in the roads , then made their way to shore and the great palace of wise 
Alcinous . 
The courts and halls and porticoes were full of the gathering , a crowd of young men and old . 
Alcinous had twelve sheep slaughtered for them , eight white-tusked boars , and two shambling oxen . 
They flayed the carcasses , dressed them , and prepared a tempting feast . / 
The 
herald 
returned , leading their skilful bard , whom the muse loved more than other men , though she gave him both good and evil : she robbed him of his sight , but gifted him the power of sweet song . Pontonous , the 
herald , placed a silver-embossed chair in the midst of them all , with its back against a high pillar , and hung the ringing lyre on a peg above his head , and showed him how to find it with his hands . 
And he set a handsome table by his side , with a basket of bread , and a cup of wine to drink if he was so minded . 
Then 
they all stretched out their hands to the fine feast spread before them . / 
When 
they had satisfied their need for food and drink , the muse inspired her bard to sing of the heroes� glorious deeds , part of that tale whose fame had risen to high heaven , the quarrel between 
Achilles , Peleus� son , and 
Odysseus , who argued fiercely at the gods� rich festival , though 
Agamemnon , king of men , was secretly pleased to see a dispute between the Achaeans� finest . for 
Phoebus 
Apollo had prophesied , at sacred 
Pytho , where 
Agamemnon had crossed the stone threshold to consult the oracle , that after a quarrel sorrow would begin to overtake the 
Trojans , though by Zeus� will it was the beginning of sorrow for the 
Greeks as well . This was the bard�s song , and 
Odysseus clutched at his long purple cloak with his great hands , and dragged it over his head to hide his handsome face , ashamed lest the 
Phaeacians see the tears pouring from his eyes . 
Whenever the divine bard stopped singing , 
Odysseus wiped the tears away , drew the cloak from his head , and reaching for his two-handled cup made libations to the gods . but when the bard began again , prompted by the 
Phaeacian lords who enjoyed his song , 
Odysseus covered his head once more and groaned . / 
He hid the falling tears from all except 
Alcinous , who , aware because he sat by him , noticed all , and heard him sighing deeply . 
And he spoke , quickly , to the sea-faring 
Phaeacians : �Leaders and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , hear me . 
We have enjoyed sharing our rich feast and the music of the lyre , its companion . 
Now let us go outside and 
try our skill in various sports , so this stranger when he is home can tell his friends how much better we are than other men in boxing , wrestling , running , and leaping . � / 
With this he led the way and all followed . 
The 
herald hung the ringing lyre on the peg , and led 
Demodocus by the hand from the hall along the same path the 
Phaeacian nobles had taken to see the games . 
They headed for the gathering place , and a countless throng went with them . 
Many fine young men rose to compete : 
Acroneos and 
Ocyalus , 
Elatreus , 
Nauteus , 
Prymneus , 
Anchialus and Eretmeus , 
Ponteus and Proreus , 
Thoon , 
Anabesineos , and 
Amphialus , son of 
Polyneus , Tecton�s son . 
Euryalus too , the equal of ares , destroyer of men , and son of Naubolus who in looks and form was the finest of all the 
Phaeacians after peerless 
Laodamas . 
And flawless Alcinous� three sons as well , 
Laodamas , 
Halius and godlike 
Clytoneus . / 
The first trial was a foot race : 
they all sped from the mark along the course set out , raising the dust from the ground . 
Faultless 
Clytoneus was quickest , and taking the lead he reached the crowd , leaving the rest behind by as much as a furrow�s length in mule-ploughed land . 
Then 
they tested each other in painful bouts of wrestling , where 
Euryalus beat the best . 
Amphialus then leapt furthest , while 
Elatreus conquered with the discus , and 
Laodamas , Alcinous� fine son , won in the boxing . 
When 
they were all satisfied with the contest , 
Laodamas , said : �Friends , let�s ask the stranger whether he�s practised in any familiar sport . He�s a fine build in thighs and calves , with two strong arms , a stout neck , plenty of strength . Nor has he lost the power of youth , he is only wearied with suffering . There�s nothing like the sea to sap a man�s strength , however tough he might be . � / 
Euryalus 
replied : �Laodamas , what you say is right . Go and challenge him yourself , and make the challenge a public one . � / 
At this Alcinous� fine son came to the centre , and spoke to 
Odysseus : �Sir stranger , come , enter the contest too , if you have any skill as seems likely , since there is no greater glory for a living man than that which he wins with his own hands and feet . 
Come , prove yourself , and throw off your cares . 
Your journey will soon start . 
The ship is launched now and the crew are ready . � / �Laodamas� 
replied resourceful 
Odysseus , �why provoke me with a challenge ? 
My mind is on trouble not on play , since I have toiled and suffered greatly in the past , and now I long only to return home , and so I sit in your gathering and plead with your king and people . � / 
Euryalus answered then , mocking him to his face : �Indeed , stranger , you look like a man unused to manly sports , more like the captain of a merchant crew , trading to and fro in a sailing ship , careful for his cargo , keeping a greedy eye on freight and profit . 
You are no athlete . � / 
With a dark look , resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �Stranger , you speak unwisely , you are a man blinded by foolishness . How true it is that the gods seldom grace men equally with their gifts , of mind , form or speech . One man is meagre in appearance , but the gods crown his words with beauty , and men delight in him as he speaks sweetly in modest eloquence , conspicuous in a crowd , and looked on like a god as he crosses the 
city . Another seems an immortal , but his words lack grace . 
You too have exceptional looks a god could not better yet your mind is crippled . 
You have roused my spirit by speaking rudely . I am no novice in your sports : indeed I was one of the best when I had my youth , and strength lay in my hands . 
While now I�m constrained by pain and suffering , since I have endured many things in my passage through mortal warfare and hostile seas . 
And yet , though I�ve suffered deeply , I will join your contest , since your speech has stung me , and your words have riled me to the heart . � / 
With this he leapt to his feet , still wrapped in his cloak , and seized a discus bigger than the rest , thicker and heavier by some way than those the 
Phaeacians normally used in competition . Spinning around , he sent it from his huge hand , and it hummed as it flew : the 
Phaeacians cowered , those lords of the ship and the long oar , beneath the flying stone . Flung smoothly from the hand , it sailed past all their marks , and 
Athene , in human likeness , pegged the distance , then , spoke to him : �Stranger , even a blind man , groping with his hands , could find your mark , by far and away the furthest , and separate from the cluster . 
You can take heart from this , at any rate : none of the 
Phaeacians will meet or pass it . � / noble and long-suffering 
Odysseus was pleased by her words , happy to find a genuine supporter at the games . 
He spoke to the 
Phaeacians now with a lighter heart . / �Match that , you youngsters : I expect I�ll send another along , as far or further , in a moment . as for the rest , since you�ve angered me deeply , if anyone has the courage and the spirit , let him come and prove himself , in boxing , wrestling , running , it matters not : let any of you 
Phaeacians 
try , except 
Laodamas . for he�s my host , and who would quarrel with the one who shows him hospitality ? 
Only a worthless idiot would challenge the man who welcomes him to a foreign land . 
He would ruin his own good luck . but the rest of you I�ll not deny or disdain , wishing to know your skill and be matched with you . I am no lightweight in any of the sports men practice . I know how to handle a polished bow with skill , and I was always first to pick off a man in the enemy ranks , however many comrades stood with me to shoot at the foe . 
When we 
Achaeans fought at 
Troy only 
Philoctetes surpassed me . but I count myself the best by far of all the other mortal men on earth , who eat their bread . 
Still , I would not claim to compete with hercules , or 
Oechalian 
Eurytus , archers who vied with the gods . That�s why great 
Eurytus died swiftly , and never reached old age in his halls , because 
Apollo , challenged to an archery contest , killed him in anger . 
And the spear I hurl further than others can shoot an arrow . 
Only in running I fear one of you 
Phaeacians might best me , since I�ve been thrown about by the waves , and on my raft I could not exercise , and my legs are weakened . � / 
They all stood silent at his words . 
Only 
Alcinous answered , saying : 
Stranger , since you are not ungracious , but wish to emphasise the skills you possess , and were angered because this man taunted you at the games , making light of your powers , in a way that none would who rightly knew how to speak ; come , listen to what I say . 
Then you may recount it to some other hero , as you feast in your home with your wife and children , remembering our skill , the talents 
Zeus endowed us with from our forefather�s days . 
We may not be the greatest boxers or wrestlers , but we run fast in the race , and we are the finest sailors : and ever the feast is dear to us , the dancing and the lyre , fresh clothes , warm baths , and bed . / 
So come , you finest dancers among us 
Phaeacians , perform for this stranger , so he can tell his friends when he reaches home how we excel not only in swiftness of foot , and seamanship , but in dancing too , and in song . let someone go quickly , and fetch 
Demodocus his ringing lyre that is somewhere in the palace . � / 
The 
herald rose at godlike Alcinous� words and brought the hollow lyre from the king�s hall . 
Then nine elected officials , who organised the games , cleared a space , and marked out a wide arena for the dance . 
Next , the 
herald came forward carrying Demodocus� ringing lyre . 
The bard stood in the centre and round him a group of dancers , boys in the first flush of youth , skilled in dancing , and 
Odysseus marvelled as he gazed at their flashing feet , striking the sacred dancing floor . / 
Then the bard struck the chords that began his sweet song , and told of the love of ares and 
Aphrodite of the lovely crown , how 
they lay together in secret in Hephaestus� house , and how ares gave her a host of gifts while dishonouring the lord Hephaestus� bed . but 
Helios , the sun god , who had spied them sleeping together , came to tell him . 
When 
Hephaestus had heard the sour tale , he went to his smithy his heart set on evil , and set up his huge anvil on its block , and forged a net of chains , firm and unbreakable . 
And when , furious with ares , he had made the snare , he went to his room and marriage bed , and fastened the netting to its posts , and hung its links above from the roof beams , fine as a spider�s web , and so cunningly made it was invisible even to the blessed gods . / 
When he had spread his net over the bed , he pretended to leave for 
Lemnos , that well-ordered citadel , dearest of all the islands , to his eyes . Nor was ares of the golden reins blind to the master-craftsman Hephaestus� going , but went straight to his house , hot for the love of 
Cytherea of the lovely crown . She had scarcely left her father�s presence , that of 
mighty Cronos� son , and seated herself on arriving , when ares entered and took her hand and spoke to her : �Sweetheart , come , let us to bed , and take delight in mutual love . 
Hephaestus has left , for 
Lemnos no doubt , to visit the barbarously spoken 
Sintians . � / as he spoke it seemed a pleasant thing to her to lie with him . 
So 
they went to the bed and lay down . 
Then clever Hephaestus� cunning net fell all around them , and 
they were unable to move or raise themselves . 
They soon realised there was no escape . 
Now the great lame god approached , for 
Helios had kept watch and carried the word , and 
Hephaestus 
returned before ever reaching 
Lemnos . 
He came home , troubled in mind , and as he stood in the gateway a terrible anger seized him . 
And he cried out fiercely to all the gods : / �Father 
Zeus , and all you other blessed and immortal gods , come , see something laughable , and intolerable , how 
Aphrodite , daughter of 
Zeus , scorning me for my lameness , makes love with hateful ares because he is straight-limbed and handsome while I was born crooked . 
My parents alone are to blame for that : I wish 
they had never made me ! look how these two usurp my bed and sleep together , while I am filled with pain to see it . 
Yet 
they won�t want to lie like this much longer , I think : no , not for an instant , however much 
they are in love . They�ll soon lose their urge for bed , the net and its links will hold them instead till her father repays me all the gifts I gave him while wooing this shameless hussy , a beautiful daughter indeed but faithless . � / 
At this the gods came crowding the bronze threshold : 
Poseidon , 
Earth-Bearer , 
Hermes the messenger , and lord 
Apollo who strikes from afar . 
The goddesses stayed at home from modesty , but those deathless ones , givers of good , stood in the entrance , and when 
they saw clever Hephaestus� snare , unquenchable laughter flowed from the blessed gods . One would glance at his neighbour and say : �Ill deeds don�t prosper . 
The slow catch the swift , as 
Hephaestus here , slow as he is , has netted ares the swiftest of all the 
Olympian gods . 
He has trapped him by cunning , though lame . ares must pay the fine for adultery . � / 
Such were the comments , then lord 
Apollo , son of 
Zeus , said to 
Hermes : �Guide and 
Giver of 
Good 
Things , 
Hermes , Zeus� son , would you not care to lie in bed beside golden 
Aphrodite , even though you were snared by unbreakable chains ? � / 
The 
Messenger-God , 
Slayer of argus , 
replied : �Lord 
Apollo , 
Far-Shooter , three times as many inescapable links could hold me , and you gods could be watching , and yes , all the goddesses too , if only I might sleep with golden 
Aphrodite . � / 
At this , laughter rose from the group of immortal gods . but 
Poseidon was unsmiling , and kept begging 
Hephaestus , the master craftsman , to set ares free , speaking with winged words : �Set him free , and I promise what you ask , that he�ll pay what�s owed in the presence of the deathless gods . � / 
The illustrious lame god 
replied : �Poseidon , 
Earth-Bearer , don�t ask this of me . It�s a sad mistake for sure , to stand surety for a sad rogue . 
Will I bind you with chains , in the presence of the deathless gods , if ares shrugs off both chains and debt , and escapes ? � / but 
Poseidon , said again : �If ares shrugs off the debt and escapes , 
Hephaestus , I will pay it myself . � / To this , the illustrious lame god 
replied : �Well , I can�t refuse you , it wouldn�t be right . � 
And he loosed the net , and the two of them , free of the chains , leaped up in a trice and fled . ares headed for 
Thrace , but laughter-loving 
Aphrodite to Paphos in Cyprus , where she has a sanctuary and fragrant altar . 
There the Graces bathed her , and anointed her with such heavenly oil as gleams on the limbs of the gods who live forever . 
And 
they dressed her in beautiful clothes , marvellous to behold . This was the song of the famous bard , that delighted 
Odysseus and the 
Phaeacians famed for their long-oared ships . 
Next 
Alcinous asked 
Halius and 
Laodamas to dance by themselves , since no one else could compete with them . 
Having taken a lovely purple ball , which clever Polybus had made , one leant back and threw it high towards the shadowy clouds , while the other leapt and caught it again before his feet touched the ground . 
When 
they had repeatedly shown their skill at hurling it high , 
they threw it to and fro as 
they danced on the rich earth , while the other youths stood round the arena beating time amidst loud applause . / 
Then noble 
Odysseus spoke : �Lord 
Alcinous , most renowned of men , you claimed your dancers were best , and see , your word is good : I�m amazed at the sight . � / royal 
Alcinous was delighted at this and at once he spoke to the seafaring 
Phaeacians : / �Leaders and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , hear me . This stranger seems a man of the highest discernment . Let�s give him a friendly gift as is only right . Twelve illustrious princes rule our land , and I am the thirteenth . let each of you twelve bring him a fresh tunic and cloak , and a talent of rich gold , and let us all arrange it swiftly , so the stranger may go to his supper with a happy heart having our gifts to hand . 
And let 
Euryalus make amends with a gift and an apology , for his unfortunate words . � / 
They praised his speech , and endorsed his thought , and each sent a squire to fetch the gifts . 
Then it came to 
Euryalus to reply , saying : �Lord 
Alcinous , most renowned of men , I will make amends as you command . I will give him this bronze sword with a silver hilt , and a scabbard for it of fresh-cut ivory : it will be of great value to him . � / 
With this he placed the silver-embossed sword in 
Odysseus hands , and spoke to him winged words : �Sir stranger , I salute you , and if harsh words have been said , may the storm winds take them and blow them away . as for yourself may the gods grant you see your wife once more , and your native land , since you�ve suffered endless trouble , far from your friends . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied : �I salute you , too , my friend , and may the gods give you joy , and may you never have cause to miss the sword you give me with these words , which indeed make amends . � 
So saying he hung the silver-embossed sword from his shoulder . as the sun set the splendid gifts arrived . 
The noble squires carried these to Alcinous� palace . 
There , the sons of faultless 
Alcinous took them and placed them before their beloved mother . 
And royal 
Alcinous leading the way 
they all entered and sat on raised seats . 
Then 
mighty 
Alcinous said to 
Arete : �Wife , have a fine coffer , the best you have , brought here , and place a fresh tunic and cloak in it yourself , and heat a cauldron of water over the fire , so that when he has bathed , and seen stored away all these gifts the noble 
Phaeacians have brought , he can take pleasure in the feast and the singing . 
And I will give him this fine gold cup , so he may remember me forever when he pours libations , at home , to 
Zeus and the other gods . � / 
At this , 
Arete ordered her maids to place a large cauldron on the fire , for the bathwater . 
They filled it then piled firewood underneath . Flames licked around the cauldron�s belly , and the water was heated . 
Meanwhile 
Arete had a strong coffer from the treasure chamber brought for the stranger , and filled it with the Phaeacians� fine gifts of clothes and gold . She added a lovely tunic and cloak herself then spoke to 
Odysseus winged words : �See to its lid , and knot the cord yourself , now , lest someone rob you on the journey as you lie in sweet sleep aboard the black ship . � / 
Attending to her words , noble long-suffering 
Odysseus quickly closed the lid , and tied its cords with a subtle knot that lady Circe had taught him . 
Then the housekeeper invited him to take his bath , and the sight of it delighted him , since comforts like these had been scarce once he�d left the home of 
Calypso of the lovely tresses , where he�d been cared for like a god . 
When the maids had bathed him , and rubbed him with oil , and had clothed him in a fine tunic and cloak , he left the bath and joined the men at their wine . / 
Nausicaa , graced by the gods with beauty , was standing by a door-post of the well-built hall , and when her eyes fell on him she marvelled , and she spoke to him with winged words : �Joy to you , stranger , and may you remember me sometimes even in your own country , since you owe your life indeed to me . � / 
And resourceful 
Odysseus 
replied , saying : �Nausicaa , daughter of brave 
Alcinous , by this token may 
Zeus the 
Thunderer , Hera�s husband , grant me my homecoming , and may I see that day . 
Then I will pray to you there too , as a divinity , all my days , since you , girl , have given me life . � / 
With that he seated himself next to 
King 
Alcinous , since 
they were already serving the food and mixing the wine . 
Then the 
herald approached leading good 
Demodocus the bard , whom all honoured , and seated him in the midst of the throng , on a chair that leant against a tall pillar . 
Resourceful 
Odysseus , first cutting slices from the chine of a white-tusked boar rich with fat on either side , of which there was plenty left , spoke to the 
herald : �Take this portion of food to 
Demodocus , 
Herald , and let me welcome him , despite my grief . Bards are honoured and revered by every man on earth , for the muse has shown them the path to poetry , and loves the tribe of poets . � / 
He finished , and the 
herald took the food and handed it to noble 
Demodocus , who was delighted . 
So 
they stretched out their hands to the good things before them , and when 
they had sated their desire for food and drink , resourceful 
Odysseus spoke to the bard , saying : �Demodocus , I praise you above all mortal men , one taught by the muse , Zeus� daughter , or perhaps by 
Apollo , for you sang the Achaeans� fate with truth and feeling , all of their actions and their suffering , all the efforts 
they exerted , as if you had been there , or heard it from one who was . 
Now , come , change your theme , and sing of the making of the 
Wooden 
Horse , that 
Epeius fashioned with Athene�s help , that noble 
Odysseus contrived to have dragged inside the citadel , filled by cunning with warriors who then sacked 
Troy . tell the tale as it happened , and I will say to all mankind that the god has given you freely of the power of divine song . � / 
At his words the bard , inspired by the god , began , and raising his voice picked up the tale at the point where the 
Argives had burned their camp , boarded their oared ships , and sailed some way off , leaving glorious 
Odysseus and the rest sitting inside the 
Horse , at the Trojan�s meeting place . 
The 
Trojans themselves had dragged it into the citadel . 
There it stood , while the people sat round it , discussing it endlessly to no conclusion . Three suggestions found favour : to cut through the hollow timber with pitiless bronze , or drag it to the edge of the rock and over the cliff , or let it stand there , as a grand offering to the gods , in propitiation , which is what happened in the end . for it was their destiny to be destroyed when the 
city accepted that huge horse of wood , where the best of the 
Argives lay hidden , bringing death and ruin to 
Troy . / 
Then he sang how the 
Achaeans left their hollow hiding place , and poured from the horse , to sack the 
city . 
He sang how the other warriors dispersing through the streets , laid waste high 
Troy , but 
Odysseus , the image of ares , together with godlike 
Menelaus , sought Deiphobus� house . 
There , said the tale , 
Odysseus fought the most terrible of fights , but conquered in the end , with the help of great-hearted 
Athene . / 
So sang the famous bard . 
And Odysseus� heart melted , and tears poured from his eyes . 
He wept pitifully , as a woman weeps who throws herself on her husband�s dying body , fallen in front of his 
city and people , trying to ward off that evil moment from the 
city and his own children : watching him gasping for breath in dying , she clings to him and screams aloud , while behind her the enemy beat her back and shoulders with their spears : then she is led into captivity to endure a life of toil and suffering , her cheeks wasted pitifully with grief . 
He hid the falling tears from all except 
Alcinous , who , aware because he sat by him , noticed all , and heard him sighing deeply . 
At one he addressed the sea-faring 
Phaeacians : / �Leaders and 
Counsellors of the 
Phaeacians , hear me , and let 
Demodocus still his ringing lyre , since his song fails to give pleasure to all alike . 
From the moment of our feast when our divine bard was inspired to sing , this stranger has never stopped his sad grieving , his heart must surely be overflowing with sorrow . let the bard refrain , and let us enjoy ourselves , hosts and guest alike : that would be better . 
We prepared all this for the sake of a sacred stranger after all , this farewell and the gifts of friendship we give with love . To a man of any intelligence , a stranger , a suppliant , is dear as a brother . / 
Now , sir , for your part : don�t mask the answer to what I ask with clever subterfuge : plain speaking serves us best . tell us the name you go by at home , the name your mother and father , and the rest , in the town and countryside , give you . No one who�s born into this world , whether high or low , goes nameless : our parents give us all a name once we are born . Name your country , your people and your 
city , so our ships may take you home , steering a course by means of their own intelligence . 
Phaeacian ships have no helmsman or steering oar , for the ships themselves know our thoughts and wishes , and the cities of men , every fertile country , and hidden by mist and cloud 
they speed over the sea�s wide gulf , and never fear damage or shipwreck . Though I heard a story once from my father 
Nausithous , who used to say that 
Poseidon was angry with us because we conveyed all men , in safety . 
He claimed that some day , when a well-built 
Phaeacian ship was crossing the misty sea , returning from such a journey , 
Poseidon would strike her , and then ring our 
city with a mountain chain . 
That is what the old king claimed , and the god can do it , or leave it undone , as he wishes . / but tell me this , and speak true , where have your wanderings taken you , what countries of men have you seen ? tell me of those peoples , and their crowded cities , the cruel , savage and lawless races , and those who are good to strangers , and in their hearts fear the gods . 
And tell me why you weep , and sorrow in spirit , when you hear of the Argives� fate , of 
Troy and the 
Danaans . 
The gods engineered it , weaving the web of mortal ruin , to make a song for those as yet unborn . Perhaps some kinsman died at 
Troy , some good and loyal man , your son-in-law or your wife�s father , dearest to a man after his own flesh and blood . or a sure friend , for such is as good as a brother . � /
