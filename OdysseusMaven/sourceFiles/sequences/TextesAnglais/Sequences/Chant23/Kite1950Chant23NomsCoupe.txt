
The old woman clambered upstairs , chuckling aloud as she went , to tell her mistress her beloved husband was home . Her knees were working away , though she tottered as she went . She stood at the head of the 
bed and spoke to her lady , saying : �Penelope , dear child , wake and see with your own eyes what you�ve longed for all this time . 
Odysseus is here , he is home after so many years . 
He has killed all the proud 
Suitors who plagued the house , wasted his stores , and 
bullied his son . � / 
Then wise 
Penelope woke and answered : �My dear nurse , the gods who can make fools of the wisest , and give insight to the simple-minded , have crazed you and led your wits astray , you who were always so sensible . 
Why do you mock me , whose heart is full of tears , with this mad tale ? 
You woke me from sleep , sweet sleep that closed my eyelids and wrapped me round . 
Never have I slept so sound , since 
Odysseus sailed to ilium the Evil that it would be better not to name . Go downstairs again , back to the servant�s hall ! if any other of my women had woken me to tell me this , I�d have sent her back there with a flea in her ear , but your old age spares you . � / �Dear child , I wouldn�t mock you , � faithful 
Eurycleia replied , �it is true , 
Odysseus is here , he is home , just as I said . He�s the stranger they all insulted in the hall . 
Telemachus knew long ago he was here , but he managed to keep his father�s plans hidden , till he could revenge himself on those violent and arrogant men . � / At this , 
Penelope leapt from her 
bed in joy , and threw her arms about the old woman , with tears springing from her eyes . 
Then she spoke to her with winged words : �Dear nurse , come now , tell me truly , if it really is him come home as you say : how could he tackle the shameless 
Suitors single-handedly , with them always crowding in the house in a pack ? � / �I couldn�t see and didn�t ask , but I still heard the groans of dying men , � loyal 
Eurycleia replied . �We women sat there , terror-stricken , in the furthest depths of our thick-walled quarters , with the doors shut tight , until the moment when your son called to me from the hall , as his father had 
told him . There I found 
Odysseus standing over the corpses , lying piled around him on the solid floor . It would have gladdened your heart to see him : all spattered with blood and gore like a lion he was . 
Now the dead are heaped together at the courtyard gate , and he has had a great fire made , and is purifying our fine house . 
He sent me to call you , so come with me now , so your hearts may rejoice together , you who have known such suffering . What you long desired has happened at last . 
He has come home , alive , to his own hearth , to find you and his son here in the palace , and in his own house again he has taken revenge on the 
Suitors who did him harm . � / but cautious 
Penelope replied : �Dear nurse , don�t exult over them so soon . 
How welcome the sight of 
Odysseus here would be to everyone , above all to me and our son , you know . but this tale must be false . 
Surely one of the gods has killed the noble 
Suitors in anger , enraged by the depths of their insolence and their wickedness . 
They showed respect to never a man on this earth whether those they met were good or evil . 
So now they have suffered for their own foolish excess . 
Odysseus though has lost his life far away , and with it the chance of his coming home . � / �My child , � the loyal nurse replied , �what are you saying ? 
That your husband will never return , when he�s here at his own hearth ! 
You never believe a thing ! 
Well , let me tell you of something else that proves it : the scar from the wound the wild boar�s white tusk gave him long ago . I saw it when I washed his feet , and wanted to tell you then , but he clapped his hand over my mouth , and refused to let me speak . 
Come with me now . I�ll stake my life on it , and if I lie deal me a cruel death . � / �Dear nurse , � cautious 
Penelope replied : �wise though you are you cannot fathom the minds of the immortal gods . but , let us go to my son , so I can see the bodies of the 
Suitors , and the man who killed them . � / 
So saying , she left her room , and went downstairs , considering whether to remain distant , and question the man who was said to be her dear husband , or whether to approach him , clasp his head and hands and kiss them . but when she had crossed the stone sill , she sat down by the far wall in the firelight , opposite 
Odysseus , while he sat by a tall pillar , his eyes on the ground , waiting to see if his wife would speak as she looked at him . She sat there silently for a long time , wondering , gazing intently at his face : often failing to recognise this man dressed in foul rags . 
Then it was that 
Telemachus spoke his criticism of her behaviour : �My mother , un-motherly and hard-hearted , why do you distance yourself from my father like this , instead of sitting by his side , plying him with questions ? No other woman would steel her heart like this , and sit apart from a husband who had just returned to her and his native land , after twenty years of bitter toil . but your heart is always harder than flint . � / �My child , � cautious 
Penelope answered , �my mind is lost in wonder , and I feel powerless to speak and question him , or even look long at his face . but if it is really 
Odysseus come home , we two have a better way of recognising one another , because there are secret tokens that only the two of us know . � 
And noble long-suffering 
Odysseus smiled at this , and spoke to 
Telemachus winged words : �Telemachus , leave your mother to put me to the proof , in this , her house : she will soon be enlightened . for now , since I�m covered in 
dust , and dressed in rags , she thinks me unworthy and won�t concede I am 
Odysseus . but let us consider what to do for the best . 
Whatever the country , whoever kills even a single man , even one that dead leaves few behind to avenge him , must go into exile , abandoning his native land and kin , while we have killed the noblest youth of Ithaca , the core of its defence . Take thought of that . � / �Do you take thought , dear father , � wise 
Telemachus replied , �since they say you are the most resourceful of men , without a mortal equal . We are eager to follow you , and I know we won�t fail to support you to the best of our powers . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus answered him , saying : �
Then I�ll tell you the plan that seems best to me . Bathe first , and dress , and order the palace servants to choose fresh clothes . Then let the divine minstrel play us a lively dance on his sweet-toned lyre , so that anyone outside who hears , neighbour or passer-by , will take it for a marriage feast . 
That way there�ll be no rumour of the Suitors� deaths put abroad in the town , before we can reach our densely-wooded farm . once there we can plan to take advantage of whatever the 
Olympians send us . � / 
They listened readily to his orders and obeyed . 
The men bathed and dressed , while the women adorned themselves . 
The divine minstrel took up his sounding lyre and stirred their desire for sweet music and pleasant dance . 
The great hall echoed to the footsteps of dancing men , and elegantly dressed women , and hearing the noise outside passers-by said : �Ah , surely someone has married our much-wooed 
Queen . She was too hard-hearted to tend her husband�s great palace to the end , in hopes of his return . � 
So they talked , not knowing what was really happening . / 
Meanwhile the housekeeper , 
Eurynome , bathed great-hearted 
Odysseus , there in the house , rubbed him with oil , and dressed him in a fine tunic and cloak . 
Athene then clothed him in beauty , making him seem taller and stronger , and making the locks of his hair spring up thickly like hyacinth petals . as a clever craftsman , taught his art by 
Hephaestus and 
Pallas 
Athene , overlays silver with gold to produce a graceful finish , so the goddess graced his head and shoulders . 
He left the bath looking like an immortal . 
Then he returned to the chair , opposite his wife , and spoke to her , saying : �Lady , you must have been touched by the 
Olympian gods : they have given you a harder heart than any other woman , one that nothing can soften . No other woman would steel her heart like this , and sit apart from a husband who had just returned to her and his native land , after twenty years of bitter toil . 
Come , 
Eurycleia , make me up a 
bed to sleep in alone , since my wife�s heart is as hard as iron . � / 
And cautious 
Penelope answered : �Sir , you must have been touched by those same gods . I am not proud and scornful of you , nor am I confused . I know well how you looked when you sailed from Ithaca in your long-oared ship . 
Come then , 
Eurycleia , and have the great 
bed dragged from the fine bridal chamber he built himself , and cover it with rugs and fleeces and brightly coloured blankets . � / 
These were words to test her husband . but 
Odysseus , angered , rounded on his loyal wife : �Lady , those are truly bitter words you speak . 
Who has moved my 
bed ? 
That would be hard , even with the greatest skill , unless perhaps some god arrived who could easily choose to set it down somewhere else . but no mortal man alive however young and strong could easily shift it from its place , since a great secret went into its making , and it was my work and mine alone . a long-leafed olive tree , strong and vigorous , and thick as a pillar , grew in the courtyard . I built my room of solid stone around it , finished it off with a fine roof , and added tight-fitting timber doors . I trimmed the trunk from the roots up , after cutting off all the long-leaved olive branches , smoothed it off skilfully and well , and trued it to the line : that was my 
bedpost . I drilled holes with the auger , and with this for its beginning fitted all the smooth timbers of my bed until it was complete . I inlaid it with ivory , silver and gold , and stretched shining purple straps of ox-hide across . 
That was its secret , as I say : but lady , I no longer know if the 
bed I made is still in place . Perhaps some man has chopped through the olive-trunk , and shifted it elsewhere . � / as he spoke , revealing the unchanged truth she knew , her knees gave way and her heart melted . Bursting into tears she ran to 
Odysseus , flung her arms about his neck , and kissing his face cried : �Odysseus , don�t be angry with me , you who in everything were always the most understanding of men . Our sorrows came from the gods , who begrudged our enjoying our youth and reaching old age together . Don�t be angry , or upset , because I didn�t give you this welcome the moment I saw you . 
My heart was always full of fear that some man would come and cheat me with words . 
Many men are only out for profit . 
Helen of 
Argos , Zeus� daughter , would never have slept with a stranger from abroad , if she�d known the warrior sons of Achaea would come to fetch her home . a god it was truly that drove her to commit that act of shame : only then did she contemplate the fatal madness that brought us , too , such sorrow . 
Now you have 
told me the true secret of our marriage 
bed , that no other mortal knew but you and I and a single maidservant , 
Actoris , who was my father�s gift before I came to you , and guarded the door of our fine bridal chamber � 
Now , you convince my stubborn heart . � / Her words stirred his heart to a greater longing for tears : and he wept , clasping his beloved , loyal wife in his arms . as welcome as the sight of land to the few surviving sailors , who swim to shore escaping the grey breakers , when their solid vessel driven over the sea by wind and towering waves has been shattered by 
Poseidon , who , saved from drowning , are overjoyed when their brine-caked bodies touch the land : welcome as that was the sight of her husband , as 
Penelope 
gazed at him , never unwinding her white arms from round his neck . / Rosy-fingered 
Dawn would have risen while they wept , if the bright-eyed goddess 
Athene had not thought otherwise . She held back the long night at its ending , and golden-throned 
Dawn by Ocean�s stream , not letting her yoke the swift-hoofed horses , 
Lampus and 
Phaethon , the colts that draw her chariot , bringing light to men . / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus said to his wife at last : �Dear wife , we have not yet reached the end of our troubles . I still have a long hard labour to perform before I reach my end : or so the spirit of 
Teiresias prophesied when I descended to Hades� house to ask how my comrades and I might return home . but come to 
bed now , wife , so we may delight in rest , soothed by sweet sleep . � / �Your 
bed is ready for you whenever you wish , � wise 
Penelope answered , �now the gods have brought you home to your own country and this fine house . but since a god has put the thought in your mind , tell me about this fresh trial , since I�ll only learn of it later , and it is better to know now . � / �Lady , the gods have touched your mind , � resourceful 
Odysseus said , �why be so eager to know ? 
Still , I will tell you , hiding nothing , though your heart will gain no pleasure from it , and nor does mine . 
Teiresias 
told me to travel through many cities of men , carrying a shapely oar , till I come to a race that knows nothing of the sea , that eat no salt with their food , and have never heard of crimson-painted ships , or the well-shaped oars that serve as wings . 
And he gave me this as a sign , one I could not miss , and now I tell it you . 
When I meet another traveller who says that I carry a winnowing-fan on my broad shoulder , there I must plant my shapely oar in the ground , and make rich sacrifice to lord 
Poseidon , a ram , a bull , and a breeding-boar . 
Then leave for home , and make sacred offerings there to the deathless gods who hold the wide heavens , to all of them , and in their due order . / 
And death will come to me far from the sea , the gentlest of deaths , taking me when I am bowed with comfortable old age , and my people prosperous about me . All this he said would come true . � / �If the gods really intend a more pleasant old age for you , � said wise 
Penelope , �there is hope this will set an end to all your troubles . � / 
So they conversed , and as they spoke 
Eurynome and the nurse made up their 
bed with soft bedclothes , by the light of a blazing torch . 
When the two servants had fussed over the coverings of the great 
bed , the old nurse returned to her room to sleep , and 
Eurynome the chambermaid lit them on their way , and took her leave of them in the bridal chamber . 
Joyfully they re-enacted the rites of their own familiar 
bed . 
And 
Telemachus , and the cowherd and swineherd , stilled their dancing feet , dismissed the women , and lay down to sleep themselves in the darkened hall . / 
When 
Odysseus and 
Penelope had their fill of love�s joys , they took comfort in telling each other their tale . 
The lovely 
Queen 
told him all she had suffered at home , watching the detestable crowd of 
Suitors , who on her account slaughtered many cattle and fat sheep , and emptied whole jars of wine . 
And 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , 
told her of all the pains he had endured in his labours , and all the pain he had inflicted on men , and she loved to hear it all , and sweet sleep failed to drown her eyelids until his tale was done . / 
First he 
told of his victory over the 
Cicones : and how he came to the fertile land of the 
Lotus-Eaters : and of what the Cyclops did , and how he had made him pay the price for those brave comrades who were eaten without pity . 
Then he 
told of Aeolus� friendly welcome and how he had seen him on his way , but , not being destined to reach his dear homeland yet , how the gale took him and drove him , groaning aloud , over the teeming sea . 
How he came to Telepylus next , where the 
Laestrygonians destroyed all his ships and his fighting men , and how his was the only vessel to escape . / 
He 
told her about Circe�s cunning , and her wiles : and how he had gone to the dank halls of 
Hades to consult the spirit of 
Theban 
Teiresias , and had seen his comrades again , and the mother who had borne him and nursed him as a child . 
Then of the Sirens� voices , and their endless singing : how he had passed the 
Wandering rocks , dread 
Charybdis and 
Scylla whom no ship passed by unscathed . 
Then how his crew had slaughtered the cattle of the 
Sun , and how 
Zeus the mighty Thunderer struck his swift ship with a fiery lightning bolt , so that his noble comrades died together , though he alone escaped their dreadful fate . / 
Then he 
told how he came to 
Ogygia , the 
Nymph Calypso�s isle , and how she longed for him to wed her and imprisoned him in her echoing cave , and cared for him and swore to make him ageless and immortal , though she could never touch his heart : and how after many trials he came to the 
Phaeacians , who honoured him readily like a god , and sent him home in their ship to his beloved island , after giving him piles of gold and bronze and fabrics . 
He had reached the end of his tale when sweet sleep came to him , relaxing his limbs , and soothing the cares of his heart . / 
Now another thought occurred to the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene . 
When she considered 
Odysseus had filled his heart enough with the joys of love and sleep in his wife�s arms , she roused golden-throned 
Dawn from Ocean�s stream , to bring light to the world . 
Then 
Odysseus rose from his soft 
bed and gave his wife his orders , saying : �Wife we have had enough of trouble , you and I : you , weeping here over the many sufferings caused by my long journey home , and I , caught in a net of sorrow by 
Zeus and the other gods , far from my own country , and longing to return . but now we are back together in our own wished-for 
bed , you must take care of my wealth here in the palace , while I will seize flocks to replace those the 
Suitors 
consumed , and the 
Achaeans will give me the rest till the folds are full . I must go now to our wooded farm to find my good father , who is suffering because of me . 
And I ask this of you , dear wife , knowing your wisdom . 
When the sun is up , rumours of the Suitors� deaths in the palace will be rife . 
So go to your room upstairs with your maids , and stay there : don�t see anyone and ask no questions . � / 
So saying , he clad his shoulders with fine armour , and roused 
Telemachus , and the cowherd and swineherd , and 
told them to take their weapons in their hands . 
They obeyed , donning bronze armour , and opening the doors followed 
Odysseus outside . light flooded the earth , but 
Athene hid them in darkness , and soon led them clear of the town . / 
The old woman clambered upstairs , chuckling aloud as she went , to tell her mistress her beloved husband was home . Her knees were working away , though she tottered as she went . She stood at the head of the 
bed and spoke to her lady , saying : �Penelope , dear child , wake and see with your own eyes what you�ve longed for all this time . 
Odysseus is here , he is home after so many years . 
He has killed all the proud 
Suitors who plagued the house , wasted his stores , and 
bullied his son . � / 
Then wise 
Penelope woke and answered : �My dear nurse , the gods who can make fools of the wisest , and give insight to the simple-minded , have crazed you and led your wits astray , you who were always so sensible . 
Why do you mock me , whose heart is full of tears , with this mad tale ? 
You woke me from sleep , sweet sleep that closed my eyelids and wrapped me round .

told me to travel through many cities of men , carrying a shapely oar , till I come to a race that knows nothing of the sea , that eat no salt with their food , and have never heard of crimson-painted ships , or the well-shaped oars that serve as wings . 
And he gave me this as a sign , one I could not miss , and now I tell it you . 
When I meet another traveller who says that I carry a winnowing-fan on my broad shoulder , there I must plant my shapely oar in the ground , and make rich sacrifice to lord 
Poseidon , a ram , a bull , and a breeding-boar . 
Then leave for home , and make sacred offerings there to the deathless gods who hold the wide heavens , to all of them , and in their due order . / 
And death will come to me far from the sea , the gentlest of deaths , taking me when I am bowed with comfortable old age , and my people prosperous about me . All this he said would come true . � / �If the gods really intend a more pleasant old age for you , � said wise 
Penelope , �there is hope this will set an end to all your troubles . � / 
So they conversed , and as they spoke 
Eurynome and the nurse made up their 
bed with soft bedclothes , by the light of a blazing torch . 
When the two servants had fussed over the coverings of the great 
bed , the old nurse returned to her room to sleep , and 
Eurynome the chambermaid lit them on their way , and took her leave of them in the bridal chamber . 
Joyfully they re-enacted the rites of their own familiar 
bed . 
And 
Telemachus , and the cowherd and swineherd , stilled their dancing feet , dismissed the women , and lay down to sleep themselves in the darkened hall . / 
When 
Odysseus and 
Penelope had their fill of love�s joys , they took comfort in telling each other their tale . 
The lovely 
Queen 
told him all she had suffered at home , watching the detestable crowd of 
Suitors , who on her account slaughtered many cattle and fat sheep , and emptied whole jars of wine . 
And 
Odysseus , scion of 
Zeus , 
told her of all the pains he had endured in his labours , and all the pain he had inflicted on men , and she loved to hear it all , and sweet sleep failed to drown her eyelids until his tale was done . / 
First he 
told of his victory over the 
Cicones : and how he came to the fertile land of the 
Lotus-Eaters : and of what the Cyclops did , and how he had made him pay the price for those brave comrades who were eaten without pity . 
Then he 
told of Aeolus� friendly welcome and how he had seen him on his way , but , not being destined to reach his dear homeland yet , how the gale took him and drove him , groaning aloud , over the teeming sea . 
How he came to Telepylus next , where the 
Laestrygonians destroyed all his ships and his fighting men , and how his was the only vessel to escape . / 
He 
told her about Circe�s cunning , and her wiles : and how he had gone to the dank halls of 
Hades to consult the spirit of 
Theban 
Teiresias , and had seen his comrades again , and the mother who had borne him and nursed him as a child . 
Then of the Sirens� voices , and their endless singing : how he had passed the 
Wandering rocks , dread 
Charybdis and 
Scylla whom no ship passed by unscathed . 
Then how his crew had slaughtered the cattle of the 
Sun , and how 
Zeus the mighty Thunderer struck his swift ship with a fiery lightning bolt , so that his noble comrades died together , though he alone escaped their dreadful fate . / 
Then he 
told how he came to 
Ogygia , the 
Nymph Calypso�s isle , and how she longed for him to wed her and imprisoned him in her echoing cave , and cared for him and swore to make him ageless and immortal , though she could never touch his heart : and how after many trials he came to the 
Phaeacians , who honoured him readily like a god , and sent him home in their ship to his beloved island , after giving him piles of gold and bronze and fabrics . 
He had reached the end of his tale when sweet sleep came to him , relaxing his limbs , and soothing the cares of his heart . / 
Now another thought occurred to the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene . 
When she considered 
Odysseus had filled his heart enough with the joys of love and sleep in his wife�s arms , she roused golden-throned 
Dawn from Ocean�s stream , to bring light to the world . 
Then 
Odysseus rose from his soft 
bed and gave his wife his orders , saying : �Wife we have had enough of trouble , you and I : you , weeping here over the many sufferings caused by my long journey home , and I , caught in a net of sorrow by 
Zeus and the other gods , far from my own country , and longing to return . but now we are back together in our own wished-for 
bed , you must take care of my wealth here in the palace , while I will seize flocks to replace those the 
Suitors 
consumed , and the 
Achaeans will give me the rest till the folds are full . I must go now to our wooded farm to find my good father , who is suffering because of me . 
And I ask this of you , dear wife , knowing your wisdom . 
When the sun is up , rumours of the Suitors� deaths in the palace will be rife . 
So go to your room upstairs with your maids , and stay there : don�t see anyone and ask no questions . � / 
So saying , he clad his shoulders with fine armour , and roused 
Telemachus , and the cowherd and swineherd , and 
told them to take their weapons in their hands . 
They obeyed , donning bronze armour , and opening the doors followed 
Odysseus outside . light flooded the earth , but 
Athene hid them in darkness , and soon led them clear of the town . /
