Odysseus answered the king , saying : �Lord 
Alcinous , most illustrious of men , it is a fine thing , in truth , to hear a bard such as this , with a godlike voice . I say myself there is nothing more delightful than when all the people feel this joy , and the banqueters sit in their rows , listening to the minstrel in the hall , tables in front of them laden with meat and bread , while the steward pours wine from the bowl , and carries it round and fills the cups . It seems the loveliest thing of all to me . / but your heart prompts you to ask of my sad troubles , and make me weep and groan the more . 
How shall I start and end my tale ? 
First let me give you my name , so you all know , and if I escape from pitiless fate later , I will play host to you , though I live far off . I am 
Odysseus , Laertes� son , known to all for my stratagems , and my fame has reached the heavens . 
My home is under Ithaca�s clear skies : our 
Mount 
Neriton , clothed with whispering forest is visible from afar : and clustered round it are many isles , 
Dulichium and 
Same and wooded 
Zacynthus . Ithaca itself lies low in the sea , furthest towards the west , while the others are separate , towards the dawn and the rising sun . It�s a rugged land , but nurtures fine young men : and speaking for myself I know nothing sweeter than one�s own country . 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , kept me there in her echoing caves , because she wished me for her husband , and in the same way 
Circe , the 
Aeaean witch , detained me in her palace , longing to make me hers : but 
they failed to move my heart . 
Surely nothing is sweeter than a man�s own parents and country , even though he lives in a wealthy house , in a foreign land far from those parents . but let me tell you of my sad voyage back from 
Troy , that 
Zeus had willed . / 
The wind carried me from ilium to 
Ismarus , 
city of the 
Cicones . I sacked the 
city and slew the men , and the women and riches we split between us , so that as far as I could determine no man lacked an equal share . 
Then as you might imagine I ordered us to slip away quickly , but my foolish followers wouldn�t listen . 
They drank the wine , and slaughtered many sheep and shambling cattle with twisted horns . 
Meanwhile the 
Cicones rounded up others , their neighbours further inland , more numerous and braver , men skilled at fighting their enemies from chariots and on foot , as needed . 
At dawn 
they came , as many as the leaves and flowers of the spring : and disaster sent by 
Zeus overtook us , doomed , as we were , to endless trouble . 
Drawing up their ranks by the swift ships , 
they fought us , each side hurling bronze-tipped spears at the other . 
Through that morning , while the sacred light grew stronger , we 
held our ground and kept their greater force at bay . but as the sun fell , at the time when oxen are unyoked , the 
Cicones succeeded in routing the 
Acheans , and six of my well-armoured comrades died from each ship , but the rest of us cheated death and evil fate . � / �From 
Ismarus we sailed , with heavy hearts for the loyal friends lost , though happy to have escaped death ourselves : nor would I let the curved ships leave till we had called three times in ritual to each of our luckless comrades , who died there on the plain , at the hands of the 
Cicones . but 
Zeus , the 
Cloud-Gatherer , stirred the north wind against our ships , in a blinding tempest , hiding the land and sea alike in cloud , while darkness swept from the sky . 
Headlong the ships were driven , sails torn to shreds by the force of the gale . in terror of death we lowered the masts on deck , and rowed the vessels wildly towards land . / 
There we stayed for two days and nights , troubled at heart with weariness and grief . but when 
Dawn of the lovely tresses gave birth to the third day , we upped masts , hoisted the white sails , and took our seats aboard , and the wind and helmsman kept us on course . 
Now I would have reached home safely , but as I was rounding cape Malea , the north wind and waves and the ocean currents beat me away , off course , past 
Cythera . / for nine days I was driven by fierce winds over the teeming sea : but on the tenth we set foot on the shores of the Lotus-eaters , who eat its flowery food . on land we drew water , and my friends ate by the ships . once we had tasted food and drink , I sent some of the men inland to discover what kind of human beings lived there : selecting two and sending a third as herald . 
They left at once and came upon the Lotus-eaters , who had no thought of killing my comrades , but gave them lotus to eat . Those who ate the honey-sweet lotus fruit no longer wished to bring back word to us , or sail for home . 
They wanted to stay with the Lotus-eaters , eating the lotus , forgetting all thoughts of return . I dragged those men back to the shore myself by force , while 
they wept , and bound them tight in the hollow ships , pushing them under the benches . 
Then I ordered my men to embark quickly on the fast craft , fearing that others would eat the lotus and forget their homes . 
They boarded swiftly and took their place on the benches then sitting in their rows struck the grey water with their oars . � / �From there we sailed with heavy hearts , and came to the land of the cyclopes , a lawless , aggressive people , who never lift their hands to plant or plough , but rely on the immortal gods . 
Wheat , barley , and vines with their richly clustered grapes , grow there without ploughing or sowing , and rain from 
Zeus makes them flourish . 
The cyclopes have no council meetings , no code of law , but live in echoing caves on the mountain slopes , and each man lays down the law to his wives and children , and disregards his neighbours . / a fertile island lies slantwise outside the Cyclopes� harbour , well wooded and neither close to nor far from shore . 
Countless wild goats inhabit it , since there is nothing to stop them , no hunters to suffer the hardship of beating a path through its woods , or to roam its mountaintops . 
There are no flocks , and no ploughed fields : but always unsown , and untilled it is free of mankind and nurtures only bleating goats . 
The cyclopes have no vessels with crimson-painted prows , no shipwrights to build sound boats with oars , to meet their need and let them travel to other men�s cities , as other races visit each other over the sea in ships , no craftsmen that is who might also have turned it into a fine colony . for this island is by no means poor , but would carry any crop in due season . 
There are rich well-watered meadows there , along the shore of the grey sea , where vines would never fail . 
There is level land for the plough with soil so rich 
they could reap a dense harvest in season . 
And there�s a safe harbour where there�s no need for moorings , neither anchor stones nor hawsers : you can beach your ship and wait till the wind is fair and the spirit moves you to sail . / 
Now , at the head of the harbour a stream of bright water flows out from a cave ringed by poplars . 
We entered , and some god must have guided us through the murky night , since it was too dark to see , a mist shrouded the ships , and the moon covered with cloud gave not a gleam of light . No one could see the land , or the long breakers striking the beach , until we had run our oared ships aground . once 
they were beached we lowered sail and went on shore , then we lay down where we were to sleep , and waited for the light of dawn . � / �As soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , we explored the island , marvelling at what we saw . 
The 
Nymphs , daughters of aegis-bearing 
Zeus , disturbed the mountain goats , 
driving them towards my hungry comrades . 
Quickly we brought our curved bows and long spears from the ships , and splitting three ways began to hunt them , and the god soon gave us a fine enough kill . Nine goats were given to each of the twelve ships in my command , and there were ten left for me . / 
So all day long till the sun set we sat and feasted on copious meat and mellow wine , since each of the crews had drawn off a large supply in jars when we took the Cicones� sacred citadel , and some of the red was left . 
Looking across to the land of the neighbouring cyclopes , we could see smoke and hear their voices , and the sound of their sheep and goats . Sun set and darkness fell , and we settled to our rest on the shore . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , I gathered my men together , saying : �The rest of you loyal friends stay here , while I and my crew take ship and try and find out who these men are , whether 
they are cruel , savage and lawless , or good to strangers , and in their hearts fear the gods . � / 
With this I went aboard and ordered my crew to follow and loose the cables . 
They boarded swiftly and took their place on the benches then sitting in their rows struck the grey water with their oars . 
When we had reached the nearby shore , we saw a deep cave overhung with laurels at the cliff�s edge close to the sea . large herds of sheep and goats were penned there at night , and round it was a raised yard walled by deep-set stones , tall pines and high-crowned oaks . 
There a giant spent the night , one that grazed his herds far off , alone , and keeping clear of others , lived in lawless solitude . 
He was born a monster and a wonder , not like any ordinary human , but like some wooded peak of the high mountains , that stands there isolated to our gaze . � / �Then I ordered the rest of my loyal friends to stay there and guard the ship , while I selected the twelve best men and went forward . I took with me a goatskin filled with dark sweet wine that Maron , son of 
Euanthes , priest of 
Apollo guardian god of 
Ismarus , had given me , because out of respect we protected him , his wife and child . 
He offered me splendid gifts , seven talents of well-wrought gold , and a silver mixing-bowl : and wine , twelve jars in all , sweet unmixed wine , a divine draught . none of his serving-men and maids knew of this store , only he and his loyal wife , and one housekeeper . 
When 
they drank that honeyed red wine , he would pour a full cup into twenty of water , and the bouquet that rose from the mixing bowl was wonderfully sweet : in truth no one could hold back . I filled a large goatskin with the wine , and took it along , with some food in a bag , since my instincts told me the giant would come at us quickly , a savage being with huge strength , knowing nothing of right or law . / 
Soon we came to the cave , and found him absent , he was grazing his well-fed flocks in the fields . 
So we went inside and marvelled at its contents . 
There were baskets full of cheeses , and pens crowded with lambs and kids , each flock with its firstlings , later ones , and newborn separated . 
The pails and bowls for milking , all solidly made , were swimming with whey . 
At first my men begged me to take some cheeses and go , then to drive the lambs and kids from the pens down to the swift ship and set sail . but I would not listen , though it would have been best , wishing to see the giant himself , and test his hospitality . 
When he did appear he proved no joy to my men . / 
So we lit a fire and made an offering , and helped ourselves to the cheese , and sat in the cave eating , waiting for him to return , shepherding his flocks . 
He arrived bearing a huge weight of dry wood to burn at suppertime , and he flung it down inside the cave with a crash . Gripped by terror we shrank back into a deep corner . 
He drove his well-fed flocks into the wide cave , the ones he milked , leaving the rams and he-goats outside in the broad courtyard . 
Then he lifted his door , a huge stone , and set it in place . Twenty-two four-wheeled wagons could not have carried it , yet such was the great rocky mass he used for a door . 
Then he sat and milked the ewes , and bleating goats in order , putting her young to each . 
Next he curdled half of the white milk , and stored the whey in wicker baskets , leaving the rest in pails for him to drink for his supper . 
When he had busied himself at his tasks , and kindled a fire , he suddenly saw us , and said : �Strangers , who are you ? 
Where do you sail from over the sea-roads ? are you on business , or do you roam at random , like pirates who chance their lives to bring evil to others ? � / �Our spirits fell at his words , in terror at his loud voice and monstrous size . Nevertheless I answered him , saying ; �We are 
Achaeans , returning from 
Troy , driven over the ocean depths by every wind that blows . 
Heading for home we were forced to take another route , a different course , as 
Zeus , I suppose , intended . 
We are followers of 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son , whose fame spreads widest on earth , so great was that 
city he sacked and host he slew . but we , for our part , come as suppliant to your knees , hoping for hospitality , and the kindness that is due to strangers . 
Good sir , do not refuse us : respect the gods . 
We are suppliants and 
Zeus protects visitors and suppliants , 
Zeus the god of guests , who follows the steps of sacred travellers . � / His answer was devoid of pity . �Stranger , you are a foreigner or a fool , telling me to fear and revere the gods , since the cyclopes care nothing for aegis-bearing 
Zeus : we are greater than 
they . I would spare neither you nor your friends , to evade Zeus� anger , but only as my own heart prompted . / but tell me , now , where you moored your fine ship , when you landed . 
Was it somewhere nearby , or further off ? I�d like to know . � / His words were designed to fool me , but failed . I was too wise for that , and answered him with cunning words : �Poseidon , 
Earth-Shaker , smashed my ship to pieces , wrecking her on the rocks that edge your island , 
driving her close to the headland so the wind threw her onshore . but I and my men here escaped destruction . � / 
Devoid of pity , he was silent in response , but leaping up laid hands on my crew . 
Two he seized and dashed to the ground like whelps , and their brains ran out and stained the earth . 
He tore them limb from limb for his supper , eating the flesh and entrails , bone and marrow , like a mountain lion , leaving nothing . 
Helplessly we watched these cruel acts , raising our hands to heaven and weeping . 
When the 
Cyclops had filled his huge stomach with human flesh , and had drunk pure milk , he lay down in the cave , stretched out among his flocks . 
Then I formed a courageous plan to steal up to him , draw my sharp sword , and feeling for the place where the midriff supports the liver , stab him there . but the next thought checked me . Trapped in the cave we would certainly die , since we�d have no way to move the great stone from the wide entrance . 
So , sighing , we waited for bright day . � / �As soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
Cyclops relit the fire . 
Then he milked the ewes , and bleating goats in order , putting her young to each . 
When he had busied himself at his tasks , he again seized two of my men and began to eat them . 
When he had finished he drove his well-fed flocks from the cave , effortlessly lifting the huge door stone , and replacing it again like the cap on a quiver . 
Then whistling loudly he turned his flocks out on to the mountain slopes , leaving me with murder in my heart searching for a way to take vengeance on him , if 
Athene would grant me inspiration . 
The best plan seemed to be this : / 
The Cyclops� huge club , a trunk of green olive wood he had cut to take with him as soon as it was seasoned , lay next to a sheep pen . It was so large and thick that it looked to us like the mast of a twenty-oared black ship , a broad-beamed merchant vessel that sails the deep ocean . 
Approaching it , I cut off a six-foot length , gave it to my men and told them to smooth the wood . 
Then standing by it I sharpened the end to a point , and hardened the point in the blazing fire , after which I hid it carefully in a one of the heaps of dung that lay around the cave . I ordered the men to cast lots as to which of them should dare to help me raise the stake and twist it into the Cyclops� eye when sweet sleep took him . 
The lot fell on the very ones I would have chosen , four of them , with myself making a fifth . / 
He 
returned at evening , shepherding his well-fed flocks . 
He herded them swiftly , every one , into the deep cave , leaving none in the broad yard , commanded to do so by a god , or because of some premonition . 
Then he lifted the huge door stone and set it in place , and sat down to milk the ewes and bleating goats in order , putting her young to each . but when he had busied himself at his tasks , he again seized two of my men and began to eat them . 
That was when I went up to him , holding an ivy-wood bowl full of dark wine , and said : �Here , 
Cyclops , have some wine to follow your meal of human flesh , so you can taste the sort of drink we carried in our ship . I was bringing the drink to you as a gift , hoping you might pity me and help me on my homeward path : but your savagery is past bearing . cruel man , why would anyone on earth ever visit you again , when you behave so badly ? � / 
At this , he took the cup and drained it , and found the sweet drink so delightful he asked for another draught : �Give me more , freely , then quickly tell me your name so I may give you a guest gift , one that will please you . Among us cyclopes the fertile earth produces rich grape clusters , and Zeus� rain swells them : but this is a taste from a stream of ambrosia and nectar . �� / �As he finished speaking I handed him the bright wine . Three times I poured and gave it to him , and three times , foolishly , he drained it . 
When the wine had fuddled his wits I tried him with subtle words : �Cyclops , you asked my name , and I will tell it : give me afterwards a guest gift as you promised . 
My name is 
Nobody . 
Nobody , my father , mother , and friends call me . � / Those were my words , and this his cruel answer : �Then , my gift is this . I will eat 
Nobody last of all his company , and all the others before him� . / as he spoke , he reeled and toppled over on his back , his thick neck twisted to one side , and all-conquering sleep overpowered him . in his drunken slumber he vomited wine and pieces of human flesh . 
Then I thrust the stake into the depth of the ashes to heat it , and inspired my men with encouraging words , so none would hang back from fear . 
When the olivewood stake was glowing hot , and ready to catch fire despite its greenness , I drew it from the coals , then my men stood round me , and a god breathed courage into us . 
They 
held the sharpened olivewood stake , and thrust it into his eye , while I threw my weight on the end , and twisted it round and round , as a man bores the timbers of a ship with a drill that others twirl lower down with a strap 
held at both ends , and so keep the drill continuously moving . 
We took the red-hot stake and twisted it round and round like that in his eye , and the blood poured out despite the heat . His lids and brows were scorched by flame from the burning eyeball , and its roots crackled with fire . as a great axe or adze causes a vast hissing when the smith dips it in cool water to temper it , strengthening the iron , so his eye hissed against the olivewood stake . 
Then he screamed , terribly , and the rock echoed . Seized by terror we shrank back , as he wrenched the stake , wet with blood , from his eye . 
He flung it away in frenzy , and called to the cyclopes , his neighbours who lived in caves on the windy heights . 
They heard his cry , and crowding in from every side 
they stood by the cave mouth and asked what was wrong : �Polyphemus , what terrible pain is this that makes you call through deathless night , and wake us ? 
Is a mortal stealing your flocks , or trying to kill you by violence or treachery ? � / out of the cave came mighty Polyphemus� voice : �Nobody , my friends , is trying to kill me by violence or treachery . � / To this 
they replied with winged words : �If you are alone , and nobody does you violence , it�s an inescapable sickness that comes from 
Zeus : pray to the lord 
Poseidon , our father . � / �Off 
they went , while I laughed to myself at how the name and the clever scheme had deceived him . 
Meanwhile the 
Cyclops , groaning and in pain , groped around and laboured to lift the stone from the door . 
Then he sat in the entrance , arms outstretched , to catch anyone stealing past among his sheep . 
That was how foolish he must have thought I was . I considered the best way of escaping , and saving myself , and my men from death . I dreamed up all sorts of tricks and schemes , as a man will in a life or death matter : it was an evil situation . This was the plan that seemed best . 
The rams were fat with thick fleeces , fine large beasts with deep black wool . These I silently tied together in threes , with twists of willow on which that lawless monster , 
Polyphemus , slept . 
The middle one was to carry one of my men , with the other two on either side to protect him . 
So there was a man to every three sheep . as for me I took the pick of the flock , and curled below his shaggy belly , gripped his back and lay there face upwards , patiently gripping his fine fleece tight in my hands . 
Then , sighing , we waited for the light . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , the males rushed out to graze , while the un-milked females udders bursting bleated in the pens . 
Their master , tormented by agonies of pain , felt the backs of the sheep as 
they passed him , but foolishly failed to see my men tied under the rams� bellies . 
My ram went last , burdened by the weight of his fleece , and me and my teeming thoughts . 
And as he felt its back , mighty 
Polyphemus spoke to him : / �My fine ram , why leave the cave like this last of the flock ? 
You have never lagged behind before , always the first to step out proudly and graze on the tender grass shoots , always first to reach the flowing river , and first to show your wish to return at evening to the fold . 
Today you are last of all . 
You must surely be grieving over your master�s eye , blinded by an evil man and his wicked friends , when my wits were fuddled with wine : 
Nobody , I say , has not yet escaped death . if you only had senses like me , and the power of speech to tell me where he hides himself from my anger , then I�d strike him down , his brains would be sprinkled all over the floor of the cave , and my heart would be eased of the pain that nothing , 
Nobody , has brought me . � / 
With this he drove the ram away from him out of doors , and I loosed myself when the ram was a little way from the cave , then untied my men . 
Swiftly , keeping an eye behind us , we shepherded those long-limbed sheep , rich and fat , down to the ship . 
And a welcome sight , indeed , to our dear friends were we , escapees from death , though 
they wept and sighed for the others we lost . I would not let them weep though , but stopped them all with a nod and a frown . I told them to haul the host of fine-fleeced sheep on board and put to sea . 
They boarded swiftly and took their place on the benches then sitting in their rows struck the grey water with their oars . 
When we were almost out of earshot , I shouted to the 
Cyclops , mocking him : �It seems he was not such a weakling , then , 
Cyclops , that man whose friends you meant to tear apart and eat in your echoing cave . Stubborn brute not shrinking from murdering your guests in your own house , your evil deeds were bound for sure to fall on your own head . 
Zeus and the other gods have had their revenge on you . �� / �He was enraged all the more by my words , and shattering the crest of a tall cliff , he hurled it at us , so that it fell seaward of our blue-prowed vessel , and almost struck the steering oar . 
The water surged beneath the stone as it fell , and the backwash like a tidal swell from the open sea , carried the ship landward and drove it onto the shore . but seizing a long pole in my hands , I pushed the boat off , and rousing my men ordered them with urgent signs to bend to the oars and save us from disaster . 
They bent to their oars and rowed , but as soon as we had put water behind us and doubled our distance I began shouting to the 
Cyclops , though the men round me called out on every side , trying to deter me with their appeals : �Why provoke the savage to anger in this stubborn way ? 
The rock he threw into the sea just now drove the ship back on shore , and we thought we were done for . if he had been able to hear us speak but a word , he would have hurled another jagged stone , and crushed our heads and the ship�s timbers with the power of his throw . � / 
So 
they 
argued , but could not daunt my ardent spirit , and I shouted to him again in anger : �Cyclops , if any man asks how you came by your blindness , say that 
Odysseus , sacker of cities , Laertes� son , a native of Ithaca , maimed you . � / 
At this he groaned , and said in answer : �Alas ! 
The truth of that prophecy spoken long ago is fulfilled ! 
Telemus , the seer , son of 
Eurymus , a tall fine man , lived here once , the greatest of prophets , and grew old here as soothsayer among the cyclopes . 
He told me that all of this would come to pass one day , and I would lose my sight at 
Odysseus� hands . but I always expected some tall fine man , one of great strength , and now a puny good-for-nothing weakling blinds my eye , after plying me with wine . Come here , Odysseus , nevertheless , so that I might grant you guest gifts , and urge the great 
Earth-Shaker to see you home , since I am his son , and he says he is my father , and he , of his will , can heal me , where no other of the blessed gods or men can . � / I replied , saying : �I wish I could rob you of life and spirit , and send you to the house of Hades , as surely as the 
Earth-Shaker will fail to heal your eye . �� / �At my words , he stretched out his hands to the starry heavens , and prayed to the lord 
Poseidon : �Hear me , 
Poseidon , dark-tressed 
Earth-Bearer , if I am your son , if you say you are my father , let 
Odysseus , sacker of cities and son of 
Laertes , never reach his home on Ithaca : yet if he is destined to see his friends and his fine house in his own country , may he come there late and in sore distress , in another�s ship , losing all comrades , and let him find great trouble in his house . � / 
So he prayed , and the dark-tressed god heard him . 
Then the 
Cyclops lifted an even larger rock , swung it in the air , and hurled it , with all his strength . It fell not far behind our blue-prowed ship , narrowly missing the tip of the steering oar , and the sea surged up around the falling stone , and its wave carried the ship forward and drove it to the far shore . / 
So we reached the island where our other oared ships lay , with our friends round them , watching for us , and weeping . 
There we beached our vessel , and went on shore . 
We landed the Cyclops� flocks from the hold and divided them among us , so that as far as I could determine no man lacked an equal share . 
The ram my comrades in arms granted to me , as a separate gift , and when the flocks had been divided there on the shore I sacrificed to 
Zeus of the dark clouds , son of 
Cronos , lord of all , and I burned the thigh pieces . but he ignored my sacrifice , planning instead the destruction of my oared ships and my faithful friends . / All day long till sunset we sat feasting on our plentiful supplies of meat and sweet wine , and when the sun was down and darkness fell we settled to sleep on the sand . as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , I roused my men , and ordered them to embark and loose the hawsers . 
They boarded swiftly and took their place on the benches then sitting in their rows struck the grey water with their oars . / 
So we sailed on , with heavy hearts for the loyal friends lost , though happy to have escaped death ourselves . � / 
Resourceful 
Odysseus answered the king , saying : �Lord 
Alcinous , most illustrious of men , it is a fine thing , in truth , to hear a bard such as this , with a godlike voice . I say myself there is nothing more delightful than when all the people feel this joy , and the banqueters sit in their rows , listening to the minstrel in the hall , tables in front of them laden with meat and bread , while the steward pours wine from the bowl , and carries it round and fills the cups . It seems the loveliest thing of all to me . / but your heart prompts you to ask of my sad troubles , and make me weep and groan the more . 
How shall I start and end my tale ? 
First let me give you my name , so you all know , and if I escape from pitiless fate later , I will play host to you , though I live far off . I am 
Odysseus , Laertes� son , known to all for my stratagems , and my fame has reached the heavens . 
My home is under Ithaca�s clear skies : our 
Mount 
Neriton , clothed with whispering forest is visible from afar : and clustered round it are many isles , 
Dulichium and 
Same and wooded 
Zacynthus . Ithaca itself lies low in the sea , furthest towards the west , while the others are separate , towards the dawn and the rising sun . It�s a rugged land , but nurtures fine young men : and speaking for myself I know nothing sweeter than one�s own country . 
Calypso , the lovely goddess , kept me there in her echoing caves , because she wished me for her husband , and in the same way 
Circe , the 
Aeaean witch , detained me in her palace , longing to make me hers : but 
they failed to move my heart . 
Surely nothing is sweeter than a man�s own parents and country , even though he lives in a wealthy house , in a foreign land far from those parents . but let me tell you of my sad voyage back from 
Troy , that 
Zeus had willed . / 
The wind carried me from ilium to 
Ismarus , 
city of the 
Cicones . I sacked the 
city and slew the men , and the women and riches we split between us , so that as far as I could determine no man lacked an equal share . 
Then as you might imagine I ordered us to slip away quickly , but my foolish followers wouldn�t listen . 
They drank the wine , and slaughtered many sheep and shambling cattle with twisted horns . 
Meanwhile the 
Cicones rounded up others , their neighbours further inland , more numerous and braver , men skilled at fighting their enemies from chariots and on foot , as needed . 
At dawn 
they came , as many as the leaves and flowers of the spring : and disaster sent by 
Zeus overtook us , doomed , as we were , to endless trouble . 
Drawing up their ranks by the swift ships , 
they fought us , each side hurling bronze-tipped spears at the other . 
Through that morning , while the sacred light grew stronger , we 
held our ground and kept their greater force at bay . but as the sun fell , at the time when oxen are unyoked , the 
Cicones succeeded in routing the 
Acheans , and six of my well-armoured comrades died from each ship , but the rest of us cheated death and evil fate . � / �From 
Ismarus we sailed , with heavy hearts for the loyal friends lost , though happy to have escaped death ourselves : nor would I let the curved ships leave till we had called three times in ritual to each of our luckless comrades , who died there on the plain , at the hands of the 
Cicones . but 
Zeus , the 
Cloud-Gatherer , stirred the north wind against our ships , in a blinding tempest , hiding the land and sea alike in cloud , while darkness swept from the sky . 
Headlong the ships were driven , sails torn to shreds by the force of the gale . in terror of death we lowered the masts on deck , and rowed the vessels wildly towards land . / 
There we stayed for two days and nights , troubled at heart with weariness and grief . but when 
Dawn of the lovely tresses gave birth to the third day , we upped masts , hoisted the white sails , and took our seats aboard , and the wind and helmsman kept us on course . 
Now I would have reached home safely , but as I was rounding cape Malea , the north wind and waves and the ocean currents beat me away , off course , past 
Cythera . / for nine days I was driven by fierce winds over the teeming sea : but on the tenth we set foot on the shores of the Lotus-eaters , who eat its flowery food . on land we drew water , and my friends ate by the ships . once we had tasted food and drink , I sent some of the men inland to discover what kind of human beings lived there : selecting two and sending a third as herald . 
They left at once and came upon the Lotus-eaters , who had no thought of killing my comrades , but gave them lotus to eat . Those who ate the honey-sweet lotus fruit no longer wished to bring back word to us , or sail for home . 
They wanted to stay with the Lotus-eaters , eating the lotus , forgetting all thoughts of return . I dragged those men back to the shore myself by force , while 
they wept , and bound them tight in the hollow ships , pushing them under the benches . 
Then I ordered my men to embark quickly on the fast craft , fearing that others would eat the lotus and forget their homes . 
They boarded swiftly and took their place on the benches then sitting in their rows struck the grey water with their oars . � / �From there we sailed with heavy hearts , and came to the land of the cyclopes , a lawless , aggressive people , who never lift their hands to plant or plough , but rely on the immortal gods . 
Wheat , barley , and vines with their richly clustered grapes , grow there without ploughing or sowing , and rain from 
Zeus makes them flourish . 
The cyclopes have no council meetings , no code of law , but live in echoing caves on the mountain slopes , and each man lays down the law to his wives and children , and disregards his neighbours . / a fertile island lies slantwise outside the Cyclopes� harbour , well wooded and neither close to nor far from shore . 
Countless wild goats inhabit it , since there is nothing to stop them , no hunters to suffer the hardship of beating a path through its woods , or to roam its mountaintops . 
There are no flocks , and no ploughed fields : but always unsown , and untilled it is free of mankind and nurtures only bleating goats . 
The cyclopes have no vessels with crimson-painted prows , no shipwrights to build sound boats with oars , to meet their need and let them travel to other men�s cities , as other races visit each other over the sea in ships , no craftsmen that is who might also have turned it into a fine colony . for this island is by no means poor , but would carry any crop in due season . 
There are rich well-watered meadows there , along the shore of the grey sea , where vines would never fail . 
There is level land for the plough with soil so rich 
they could reap a dense harvest in season . 
And there�s a safe harbour where there�s no need for moorings , neither anchor stones nor hawsers : you can beach your ship and wait till the wind is fair and the spirit moves you to sail . / 
Now , at the head of the harbour a stream of bright water flows out from a cave ringed by poplars . 
We entered , and some god must have guided us through the murky night , since it was too dark to see , a mist shrouded the ships , and the moon covered with cloud gave not a gleam of light . No one could see the land , or the long breakers striking the beach , until we had run our oared ships aground . once 
they were beached we lowered sail and went on shore , then we lay down where we were to sleep , and waited for the light of dawn . � / �As soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , we explored the island , marvelling at what we saw . 
The 
Nymphs , daughters of aegis-bearing 
Zeus , disturbed the mountain goats , 
driving them towards my hungry comrades . 
Quickly we brought our curved bows and long spears from the ships , and splitting three ways began to hunt them , and the god soon gave us a fine enough kill . Nine goats were given to each of the twelve ships in my command , and there were ten left for me . / 
So all day long till the sun set we sat and feasted on copious meat and mellow wine , since each of the crews had drawn off a large supply in jars when we took the Cicones� sacred citadel , and some of the red was left . 
Looking across to the land of the neighbouring cyclopes , we could see smoke and hear their voices , and the sound of their sheep and goats . Sun set and darkness fell , and we settled to our rest on the shore . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , I gathered my men together , saying : �The rest of you loyal friends stay here , while I and my crew take ship and try and find out who these men are , whether 
they are cruel , savage and lawless , or good to strangers , and in their hearts fear the gods . � / 
With this I went aboard and ordered my crew to follow and loose the cables . 
They boarded swiftly and took their place on the benches then sitting in their rows struck the grey water with their oars . 
When we had reached the nearby shore , we saw a deep cave overhung with laurels at the cliff�s edge close to the sea . large herds of sheep and goats were penned there at night , and round it was a raised yard walled by deep-set stones , tall pines and high-crowned oaks . 
There a giant spent the night , one that grazed his herds far off , alone , and keeping clear of others , lived in lawless solitude . 
He was born a monster and a wonder , not like any ordinary human , but like some wooded peak of the high mountains , that stands there isolated to our gaze . � / �Then I ordered the rest of my loyal friends to stay there and guard the ship , while I selected the twelve best men and went forward . I took with me a goatskin filled with dark sweet wine that Maron , son of 
Euanthes , priest of 
Apollo guardian god of 
Ismarus , had given me , because out of respect we protected him , his wife and child . 
He offered me splendid gifts , seven talents of well-wrought gold , and a silver mixing-bowl : and wine , twelve jars in all , sweet unmixed wine , a divine draught . none of his serving-men and maids knew of this store , only he and his loyal wife , and one housekeeper . 
When 
they drank that honeyed red wine , he would pour a full cup into twenty of water , and the bouquet that rose from the mixing bowl was wonderfully sweet : in truth no one could hold back . I filled a large goatskin with the wine , and took it along , with some food in a bag , since my instincts told me the giant would come at us quickly , a savage being with huge strength , knowing nothing of right or law . / 
Soon we came to the cave , and found him absent , he was grazing his well-fed flocks in the fields . 
So we went inside and marvelled at its contents . 
There were baskets full of cheeses , and pens crowded with lambs and kids , each flock with its firstlings , later ones , and newborn separated . 
The pails and bowls for milking , all solidly made , were swimming with whey . 
At first my men begged me to take some cheeses and go , then to drive the lambs and kids from the pens down to the swift ship and set sail . but I would not listen , though it would have been best , wishing to see the giant himself , and test his hospitality . 
When he did appear he proved no joy to my men . / 
So we lit a fire and made an offering , and helped ourselves to the cheese , and sat in the cave eating , waiting for him to return , shepherding his flocks . 
He arrived bearing a huge weight of dry wood to burn at suppertime , and he flung it down inside the cave with a crash . Gripped by terror we shrank back into a deep corner . 
He drove his well-fed flocks into the wide cave , the ones he milked , leaving the rams and he-goats outside in the broad courtyard . 
Then he lifted his door , a huge stone , and set it in place . Twenty-two four-wheeled wagons could not have carried it , yet such was the great rocky mass he used for a door . 
Then he sat and milked the ewes , and bleating goats in order , putting her young to each . 
Next he curdled half of the white milk , and stored the whey in wicker baskets , leaving the rest in pails for him to drink for his supper . 
When he had busied himself at his tasks , and kindled a fire , he suddenly saw us , and said : �Strangers , who are you ? 
Where do you sail from over the sea-roads ? are you on business , or do you roam at random , like pirates who chance their lives to bring evil to others ? � / �Our spirits fell at his words , in terror at his loud voice and monstrous size . Nevertheless I answered him , saying ; �We are 
Achaeans , returning from 
Troy , driven over the ocean depths by every wind that blows . 
Heading for home we were forced to take another route , a different course , as 
Zeus , I suppose , intended . 
We are followers of 
Agamemnon , Atreus� son , whose fame spreads widest on earth , so great was that 
city he sacked and host he slew . but we , for our part , come as suppliant to your knees , hoping for hospitality , and the kindness that is due to strangers . 
Good sir , do not refuse us : respect the gods . 
We are suppliants and 
Zeus protects visitors and suppliants , 
Zeus the god of guests , who follows the steps of sacred travellers . � / His answer was devoid of pity . �Stranger , you are a foreigner or a fool , telling me to fear and revere the gods , since the cyclopes care nothing for aegis-bearing 
Zeus : we are greater than 
they . I would spare neither you nor your friends , to evade Zeus� anger , but only as my own heart prompted . / but tell me , now , where you moored your fine ship , when you landed . 
Was it somewhere nearby , or further off ? I�d like to know . � / His words were designed to fool me , but failed . I was too wise for that , and answered him with cunning words : �Poseidon , 
Earth-Shaker , smashed my ship to pieces , wrecking her on the rocks that edge your island , 
driving her close to the headland so the wind threw her onshore . but I and my men here escaped destruction . � / 
Devoid of pity , he was silent in response , but leaping up laid hands on my crew . 
Two he seized and dashed to the ground like whelps , and their brains ran out and stained the earth . 
He tore them limb from limb for his supper , eating the flesh and entrails , bone and marrow , like a mountain lion , leaving nothing . 
Helplessly we watched these cruel acts , raising our hands to heaven and weeping . 
When the 
Cyclops had filled his huge stomach with human flesh , and had drunk pure milk , he lay down in the cave , stretched out among his flocks . 
Then I formed a courageous plan to steal up to him , draw my sharp sword , and feeling for the place where the midriff supports the liver , stab him there . but the next thought checked me . Trapped in the cave we would certainly die , since we�d have no way to move the great stone from the wide entrance . 
So , sighing , we waited for bright day . � / �As soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , 
Cyclops relit the fire . 
Then he milked the ewes , and bleating goats in order , putting her young to each . 
When he had busied himself at his tasks , he again seized two of my men and began to eat them . 
When he had finished he drove his well-fed flocks from the cave , effortlessly lifting the huge door stone , and replacing it again like the cap on a quiver . 
Then whistling loudly he turned his flocks out on to the mountain slopes , leaving me with murder in my heart searching for a way to take vengeance on him , if 
Athene would grant me inspiration . 
The best plan seemed to be this : / 
The Cyclops� huge club , a trunk of green olive wood he had cut to take with him as soon as it was seasoned , lay next to a sheep pen . It was so large and thick that it looked to us like the mast of a twenty-oared black ship , a broad-beamed merchant vessel that sails the deep ocean . 
Approaching it , I cut off a six-foot length , gave it to my men and told them to smooth the wood . 
Then standing by it I sharpened the end to a point , and hardened the point in the blazing fire , after which I hid it carefully in a one of the heaps of dung that lay around the cave . I ordered the men to cast lots as to which of them should dare to help me raise the stake and twist it into the Cyclops� eye when sweet sleep took him . 
The lot fell on the very ones I would have chosen , four of them , with myself making a fifth . / 
He 
returned at evening , shepherding his well-fed flocks . 
He herded them swiftly , every one , into the deep cave , leaving none in the broad yard , commanded to do so by a god , or because of some premonition . 
Then he lifted the huge door stone and set it in place , and sat down to milk the ewes and bleating goats in order , putting her young to each . but when he had busied himself at his tasks , he again seized two of my men and began to eat them . 
That was when I went up to him , holding an ivy-wood bowl full of dark wine , and said : �Here , 
Cyclops , have some wine to follow your meal of human flesh , so you can taste the sort of drink we carried in our ship . I was bringing the drink to you as a gift , hoping you might pity me and help me on my homeward path : but your savagery is past bearing . cruel man , why would anyone on earth ever visit you again , when you behave so badly ? � / 
At this , he took the cup and drained it , and found the sweet drink so delightful he asked for another draught : �Give me more , freely , then quickly tell me your name so I may give you a guest gift , one that will please you . Among us cyclopes the fertile earth produces rich grape clusters , and Zeus� rain swells them : but this is a taste from a stream of ambrosia and nectar . �� / �As he finished speaking I handed him the bright wine . Three times I poured and gave it to him , and three times , foolishly , he drained it . 
When the wine had fuddled his wits I tried him with subtle words : �Cyclops , you asked my name , and I will tell it : give me afterwards a guest gift as you promised . 
My name is 
Nobody . 
Nobody , my father , mother , and friends call me . � / Those were my words , and this his cruel answer : �Then , my gift is this . I will eat 
Nobody last of all his company , and all the others before him� . / as he spoke , he reeled and toppled over on his back , his thick neck twisted to one side , and all-conquering sleep overpowered him . in his drunken slumber he vomited wine and pieces of human flesh . 
Then I thrust the stake into the depth of the ashes to heat it , and inspired my men with encouraging words , so none would hang back from fear . 
When the olivewood stake was glowing hot , and ready to catch fire despite its greenness , I drew it from the coals , then my men stood round me , and a god breathed courage into us . 
They 
held the sharpened olivewood stake , and thrust it into his eye , while I threw my weight on the end , and twisted it round and round , as a man bores the timbers of a ship with a drill that others twirl lower down with a strap 
held at both ends , and so keep the drill continuously moving . 
We took the red-hot stake and twisted it round and round like that in his eye , and the blood poured out despite the heat . His lids and brows were scorched by flame from the burning eyeball , and its roots crackled with fire . as a great axe or adze causes a vast hissing when the smith dips it in cool water to temper it , strengthening the iron , so his eye hissed against the olivewood stake . 
Then he screamed , terribly , and the rock echoed . Seized by terror we shrank back , as he wrenched the stake , wet with blood , from his eye . 
He flung it away in frenzy , and called to the cyclopes , his neighbours who lived in caves on the windy heights . 
They heard his cry , and crowding in from every side 
they stood by the cave mouth and asked what was wrong : �Polyphemus , what terrible pain is this that makes you call through deathless night , and wake us ? 
Is a mortal stealing your flocks , or trying to kill you by violence or treachery ? � / out of the cave came mighty Polyphemus� voice : �Nobody , my friends , is trying to kill me by violence or treachery . � / To this 
they replied with winged words : �If you are alone , and nobody does you violence , it�s an inescapable sickness that comes from 
Zeus : pray to the lord 
Poseidon , our father . � / �Off 
they went , while I laughed to myself at how the name and the clever scheme had deceived him . 
Meanwhile the 
Cyclops , groaning and in pain , groped around and laboured to lift the stone from the door . 
Then he sat in the entrance , arms outstretched , to catch anyone stealing past among his sheep . 
That was how foolish he must have thought I was . I considered the best way of escaping , and saving myself , and my men from death . I dreamed up all sorts of tricks and schemes , as a man will in a life or death matter : it was an evil situation . This was the plan that seemed best . 
The rams were fat with thick fleeces , fine large beasts with deep black wool . These I silently tied together in threes , with twists of willow on which that lawless monster , 
Polyphemus , slept . 
The middle one was to carry one of my men , with the other two on either side to protect him . 
So there was a man to every three sheep . as for me I took the pick of the flock , and curled below his shaggy belly , gripped his back and lay there face upwards , patiently gripping his fine fleece tight in my hands . 
Then , sighing , we waited for the light . / as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , the males rushed out to graze , while the un-milked females udders bursting bleated in the pens . 
Their master , tormented by agonies of pain , felt the backs of the sheep as 
they passed him , but foolishly failed to see my men tied under the rams� bellies . 
My ram went last , burdened by the weight of his fleece , and me and my teeming thoughts . 
And as he felt its back , mighty 
Polyphemus spoke to him : / �My fine ram , why leave the cave like this last of the flock ? 
You have never lagged behind before , always the first to step out proudly and graze on the tender grass shoots , always first to reach the flowing river , and first to show your wish to return at evening to the fold . 
Today you are last of all . 
You must surely be grieving over your master�s eye , blinded by an evil man and his wicked friends , when my wits were fuddled with wine : 
Nobody , I say , has not yet escaped death . if you only had senses like me , and the power of speech to tell me where he hides himself from my anger , then I�d strike him down , his brains would be sprinkled all over the floor of the cave , and my heart would be eased of the pain that nothing , 
Nobody , has brought me . � / 
With this he drove the ram away from him out of doors , and I loosed myself when the ram was a little way from the cave , then untied my men . 
Swiftly , keeping an eye behind us , we shepherded those long-limbed sheep , rich and fat , down to the ship . 
And a welcome sight , indeed , to our dear friends were we , escapees from death , though 
they wept and sighed for the others we lost . I would not let them weep though , but stopped them all with a nod and a frown . I told them to haul the host of fine-fleeced sheep on board and put to sea . 
They boarded swiftly and took their place on the benches then sitting in their rows struck the grey water with their oars . 
When we were almost out of earshot , I shouted to the 
Cyclops , mocking him : �It seems he was not such a weakling , then , 
Cyclops , that man whose friends you meant to tear apart and eat in your echoing cave . Stubborn brute not shrinking from murdering your guests in your own house , your evil deeds were bound for sure to fall on your own head . 
Zeus and the other gods have had their revenge on you . �� / �He was enraged all the more by my words , and shattering the crest of a tall cliff , he hurled it at us , so that it fell seaward of our blue-prowed vessel , and almost struck the steering oar . 
The water surged beneath the stone as it fell , and the backwash like a tidal swell from the open sea , carried the ship landward and drove it onto the shore . but seizing a long pole in my hands , I pushed the boat off , and rousing my men ordered them with urgent signs to bend to the oars and save us from disaster . 
They bent to their oars and rowed , but as soon as we had put water behind us and doubled our distance I began shouting to the 
Cyclops , though the men round me called out on every side , trying to deter me with their appeals : �Why provoke the savage to anger in this stubborn way ? 
The rock he threw into the sea just now drove the ship back on shore , and we thought we were done for . if he had been able to hear us speak but a word , he would have hurled another jagged stone , and crushed our heads and the ship�s timbers with the power of his throw . � / 
So 
they 
argued , but could not daunt my ardent spirit , and I shouted to him again in anger : �Cyclops , if any man asks how you came by your blindness , say that 
Odysseus , sacker of cities , Laertes� son , a native of Ithaca , maimed you . � / 
At this he groaned , and said in answer : �Alas ! 
The truth of that prophecy spoken long ago is fulfilled ! 
Telemus , the seer , son of 
Eurymus , a tall fine man , lived here once , the greatest of prophets , and grew old here as soothsayer among the cyclopes . 
He told me that all of this would come to pass one day , and I would lose my sight at 
Odysseus� hands . but I always expected some tall fine man , one of great strength , and now a puny good-for-nothing weakling blinds my eye , after plying me with wine . Come here , Odysseus , nevertheless , so that I might grant you guest gifts , and urge the great 
Earth-Shaker to see you home , since I am his son , and he says he is my father , and he , of his will , can heal me , where no other of the blessed gods or men can . � / I replied , saying : �I wish I could rob you of life and spirit , and send you to the house of Hades , as surely as the 
Earth-Shaker will fail to heal your eye . �� / �At my words , he stretched out his hands to the starry heavens , and prayed to the lord 
Poseidon : �Hear me , 
Poseidon , dark-tressed 
Earth-Bearer , if I am your son , if you say you are my father , let 
Odysseus , sacker of cities and son of 
Laertes , never reach his home on Ithaca : yet if he is destined to see his friends and his fine house in his own country , may he come there late and in sore distress , in another�s ship , losing all comrades , and let him find great trouble in his house . � / 
So he prayed , and the dark-tressed god heard him . 
Then the 
Cyclops lifted an even larger rock , swung it in the air , and hurled it , with all his strength . It fell not far behind our blue-prowed ship , narrowly missing the tip of the steering oar , and the sea surged up around the falling stone , and its wave carried the ship forward and drove it to the far shore . / 
So we reached the island where our other oared ships lay , with our friends round them , watching for us , and weeping . 
There we beached our vessel , and went on shore . 
We landed the Cyclops� flocks from the hold and divided them among us , so that as far as I could determine no man lacked an equal share . 
The ram my comrades in arms granted to me , as a separate gift , and when the flocks had been divided there on the shore I sacrificed to 
Zeus of the dark clouds , son of 
Cronos , lord of all , and I burned the thigh pieces . but he ignored my sacrifice , planning instead the destruction of my oared ships and my faithful friends . / All day long till sunset we sat feasting on our plentiful supplies of meat and sweet wine , and when the sun was down and darkness fell we settled to sleep on the sand . as soon as rosy-fingered 
Dawn appeared , I roused my men , and ordered them to embark and loose the hawsers . 
They boarded swiftly and took their place on the benches then sitting in their rows struck the grey water with their oars . / 
So we sailed on , with heavy hearts for the loyal friends lost , though happy to have escaped death ourselves . � /
