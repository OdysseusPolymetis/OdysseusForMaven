
So noble long-suffering 
Odysseus lay there , conquered by weariness and sleep , while 
Athene came to the island and 
city of the 
Phaeacians . 
They had once lived in broad 
Hypereia , neighbours to the cyclopes , arrogant men , more powerful than 
they , who continually attacked them . 
Godlike 
Nausithous 
led the 
Phaeacians from there to settle in 
Scheria far from men . He ringed the 
city with a wall , built houses and temples for the gods , and divided the land into fields , but he had long since died and gone to the house of 
Hades , and now 
Alcinous was king , his wisdom inspired by the gods . Bright-eyed 
Athene came to his house , planning valiant Odysseus� return . 
She went to the richly-made room where a girl like an immortal goddess in looks and form , 
Nausicaa , daughter of noble 
Alcinous , slept , with her two handmaids by her , blessed with beauty by the 
Graces , one on each side of the doorway , and the shining doors were closed . / The goddess flew to the girl�s bed like a breath of air , and taking the form of the famed ship owner , Dymas�s daughter , a girl of similar age to 
Nausicaa , and dear to her heart , she leant over her , and said : �Nausicaa , how come your mother bore such a careless daughter ? 
Your lovely clothes are neglected , yet your marriage will soon be here , when you�ll not only need to be dressed in lovely clothes yourself , but provide for those who accompany you . 
From such things we gain good reputation among men , and our father and dear mother rejoice . Let�s go and wash the garments at daybreak : I will go with you to help , so you can have it done without delay , for you won�t be long unwed . Even now you have suitors , the noblest of 
Phaeacians , men of your own lineage . 
Come , early in the morning : ask your noble father to order a mule team and wagon for you , to carry the robes and sashes and bright coverlets . And you yourself should ride rather than travelling on foot , since the washing-pools are far from the 
city . � / 
With this , the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , left for 
Olympus , where 
they say the gods have their everlasting home . No winds blow there , no rain wets it , no snow falls , but the wide air is clear and cloudless , and over it shines a radiant brightness : there the blessed gods are always happy . 
There the bright-eyed goddess went , after speaking to the girl . / 
Dawn came , lovely and enthroned , and woke 
Nausicaa of the beautiful robes who wondering at her dream set off through the palace to tell her dear father and mother . 
She found them both there , her mother sitting with her handmaids by the hearth , spinning purple-dyed yarn , while 
Nausicaa met her father about to go and join the noble princes in the council place , called there by the 
Phaeacian lords . 
She approached him and said : �Dear 
Father , would you please order them to fetch me a high-sided , strong-wheeled wagon , so I can take my soiled finery lying here to the river for washing ? 
You yourself too really need clean clothes for your councils with the princes , and you have five sons in the palace , two married while three are free and unwed , who always want fresh clothes to wear for the dancing . I have to think of all this . � / 
She said this , being too shy to speak to her father about the possibility of marriage , but he understood it all and answered : �My child I don�t grudge you mules or anything else . Go , and the servants will ready a high-sided strong-wheeled wagon with a hood above . � 
So saying he called to the servants , and 
they obeyed . 
They readied the smooth-running mule cart outside the palace , 
led up the mules and harnessed them , and the girl brought the bright clothes from her room , and packed them into the gleaming wagon , while her mother put up a box of food , with everything to content the heart . 
There she packed delicacies , with wine in a goatskin bag : the girl climbed up , and her mother handed her a gold flask of olive oil , so that she and her maids could use it after bathing . 
Then 
Nausicaa took up the whip , and the smooth reins , and flicked the mules to start them . 
With a clatter of hooves 
they moved off smartly , carrying the girl and the clothing , and the maids too , to keep her company . / 
When 
they came to the river , lovely with streams , and never-failing pools , with enough clear water bubbling up and brimming over to wash the dirtiest clothes , 
they un-harnessed the mules and drove them along the bank of the swirling river to graze on the honey-sweet grass of the water meadows . 
They lifted armfuls of clothes from the wagon , carried them down to the clear black water , and trod them thoroughly in the pools , vying with one another . 
When 
they had washed the load and rinsed away the dirt , 
they spread the garments in lines on the beach , where the breaking waves wash the shingle cleanest . After bathing and rubbing themselves with oil , 
they ate their meal on the riverbank , and waited for the clothes to dry in the sun . / 
When 
they had enjoyed the food , 
Nausicaa and her maids threw off their headgear and played with a ball , white-armed 
Nausicaa leading the accompanying song . as 
Artemis with her bow wanders the high mountain ridges of 
Taygetus and 
Erymanthus , delighting to chase wild boar and the swift deer , while the 
Nymphs , daughters of aegis-bearing 
Zeus , join in the sport , and 
Leto her mother is glad because 
Artemis is a head taller than 
they are , and easily known , though all are lovely , so this unwed girl shone out among the maids . / 
Now when she was about to yoke the mules , and fold the fine clothes , and start for home , the goddess , bright-eyed 
Athene , had a different idea , that 
Odysseus should wake , and see the lovely girl , who would lead him to the 
Phaeacian 
city . 
When the princess threw the ball to one of her maids , she missed the maid , and it landed in deep water . At their cry , noble 
Odysseus woke , sat up , and thought : �Oh , what mortal place have I reached this time ? are 
they cruel and merciless savages , or god-fearing people , generous to strangers ? The noise in my ears sounded like girls shouting , nymphs who haunt the high mountain passes , tributary streams , and grassy meadows . Am I near creatures with human speech ? let me look , and see . � / 
With this noble 
Odysseus emerged from the bushes , breaking a leafy branch from the thicket with his strong right hand , with which to hide his manhood . He advanced like a mountain lion , sure of its strength , that defies the wind and rain with blazing eyes , leaping among the sheep and cattle , or following the wild deer�s trail , or even , driven by hunger , attacking the flocks in the strongly-built fold . 
So 
Odysseus , in his need , would have faced the crowd of girls with flowing hair , naked as he was . but , streaked with brine , he terrified them so , that 
they fled in fear , at random , over the sand spits . / 
Only Alcinous� daughter stood her ground , since 
Athene inspired her , and drove the fear from her body . 
She stood and faced 
Odysseus , and he debated whether to clasp the knees of this lovely girl , as a suppliant , or whether to keep his distance and try her with courteous words , in hopes she might give him some clothes , and show him the road to the 
city . as he debated , he thought it better to hold off , and try her with courteous words , in case she should take offence if he clasped her knees : so he spoke to her promptly , with charm and subtlety��Princess , see me at your feet . are you mortal , or a goddess ? if a goddess , one of those who keep the wide heavens , you seem to me most like 
Artemis , great Zeus� daughter , in beauty , stature and form . but if you are an earthbound mortal , three times blessed is your dear father and mother , and three times blessed are your brothers . 
How their hearts must glow with pleasure when 
they watch so sweet a flower join the dancers . but the man most blessed is he who shall woo and conquer you with his gifts , and lead you homewards . for my eyes have never looked on such a mortal woman or man as you . 
Only in 
Delos once I saw the like , a tender palm shoot springing up by Apollo�s altar , for I have been there as well , and an army with me , on that voyage where evil sorrows were my share . 
Just so I marvelled when I saw it , for never did such a tree grow on earth . And now I marvel at you , lady , in wonder , and am afraid to clasp your knees , though my troubles are harsh enough . 
Yesterday , the twentieth day , I escaped the wine-dark sea : and all that time the turbulent wind and waves carried me here from Ogygia�s isle . 
Now fate drives me on shore , so that I may suffer harm here too , no doubt . I don�t expect my sufferings to end yet : the gods will inflict many more before that moment comes . but , 
Princess , pity me : since I come to you first of all , after my heavy labours , and I know none of the people of this land or its 
city . show me the way to town , and give me some rags to throw over me , perhaps whatever wrapped the clothes you brought . And may the gods grant you all your heart�s desire , a husband and a home , and mutual harmony , in all its beauty . Since nothing is finer or better than when a man and a woman of one heart and mind stay together , a joy to their friends , a sorrow to their enemies : their own reputation of the very highest . � / 
Then 
Nausicaa of the white arms answered : �Stranger , you seem neither unknowing nor ill intentioned : it is 
Olympian 
Zeus himself who brings men good fortune , to the virtuous or not as he wills , and since he has brought you this , whatever it may be you must endure it . but , now you are come to our land and 
city , you shall not go short of clothes or anything else a hard-pressed suppliant deserves from those he meets . I will show you the way to town , and tell you whom we are . 
This is the Phaeacians� country and 
city , and I am the daughter of valiant 
Alcinous , in whom the 
Phaeacians vest their majesty and power . � / 
With this she called to her lovely maids : �Stop , girls , why do you shun the sight of a man ? 
Surely you don�t imagine he�s unfriendly ? 
There will never be mortal man so contrary as to set hostile feet on 
Phaeacian land , for we are dear to the gods . We live far-off , over the turbulent sea , the remotest of races , and deal with no other peoples . 
This man must instead be some luckless wanderer , landed here . We must care for him , since all strangers and beggars come from 
Zeus , and even a little gift is welcome . 
So bring him food and drink , girls , and bathe him in the river wherever there�s shelter from the wind . � / 
They halted , then , and called out to each other . as 
Nausicaa , daughter of valiant 
Alcinous , commanded , 
they found 
Odysseus a sheltered spot . 
They set out a tunic and cloak for him to wear , and smooth olive oil in a golden flask , and invited him to bathe in the running stream . but noble 
Odysseus spoke to them , saying : �Ladies , stand over there , since I need to wash the salt from my shoulders , and rub myself with oil , since it�s long since oil came near me , but I will not bathe with you here , and I am ashamed to stand naked among lovely women . � / At this 
they went off to inform the princess , while noble 
Odysseus with fresh water washed the brine that coated his broad shoulders and back from his skin , and scrubbed his head free of scurf from the barren sea . And when he had washed all over , and rubbed himself with oil , and put on the clothes the virgin girl had given him , 
Athene , daughter of 
Zeus , made him seem taller and stronger , and made the locks of his hair spring up thickly like hyacinth petals . as a clever craftsman , taught his art by 
Hephaestus and 
Pallas 
Athene , overlays silver with gold to produce a graceful finish , so the goddess graced his head and shoulders . 
Then he went some way off and sat on the shore , alight with that grace and beauty : and the girl gazed at him admiringly , and said to her lovely maids : / �Listen to what I say , my white-armed girls . 
This man does not come to the godlike 
Phaeacians without the gods willing it . He seemed rough to me before , but now seems like one of the gods who rule the wide heavens . I wish such a man might be my husband here , if he remains . but come , girls , give the stranger food and drink . � / 
They listened to her , and readily did as she asked , placing food and drink before 
Odysseus . 
Then noble and long-suffering 
Odysseus ate and drank eagerly , for it was a long time since he�d tasted any food . / 
Now 
Nausicaa of the white arms had another idea . 
She folded the clothes , and loaded her fine wagon with them , harnessed the strong-hooved mules , and climbed up , herself . 
Then she called to 
Odysseus and spoke to him : �Stranger , prepare to leave for town , and I will direct you to my wise father�s house , where you will meet the noblest 
Phaeacians I can assure you . but be sure to do as I say , as you seem an intelligent man : while we are in the country and among ploughed fields , walk quickly behind the mules and wagon with my maids . I will lead the way . but on the approach to the 
city , which is ringed by a high wall , there�s a fine harbour on both sides , and the causeway between is narrow , and the curved ships are drawn up to the road , each man having his own mooring . There�s a meeting place , as well , next to Poseidon�s fine temple , paved with huge stones bedded deep in the earth . 
Here the crews are busy with the black ships� tackle , with cables and sails , and here 
they carve the their thin oar blades . for 
Phaeacians are indifferent to bows and quivers , caring only for the graceful ships 
they delight to sail over the grey sea . / I wish to avoid evil gossip , or anyone�s taunts later , since there are insolent men in the crowd , and one of the cruder sort might say if he saw us : �Who is that tall and handsome stranger who trails after 
Nausicaa ? 
Where did she find him ? It�s her future husband no doubt ! 
She must have found some shipwrecked traveller , a foreigner from far off , since we have no neighbours . or maybe a god has come down from the sky to answer her endless prayers , to make her his forever ! Better that she has gone and found a husband from abroad , since she despises the Phaeacaians here , that�s clear , and all her noble suitors ! � 
So 
they will chatter , and blacken my name . I would blame any other girl , too , who did the same , who with her mother and father still alive , kept a man�s company before the wedding ceremony . 
So listen , now , to my words , stranger , so you can win my father�s help to return to your land . / 
You will find a fine grove , near the road , sacred to 
Athene , a cluster of poplar trees . a spring wells up in the centre , and there�s a meadow round about . 
My father has his estate there , his fertile vineyards , within shouting distance of the 
city . Sit there , and wait till we have reached the 
city and my father�s palace . 
When you think we are there , enter the 
Phaeacian 
city , and ask for my valiant father Alcinous� palace . It�s easy to recognise , a child , a mere infant , could show you , for noble Acinous� palace is nothing like the Phaeacians� houses . / 
When the courtyard and palace enclose you , go straight through the great hall , till you come to my mother , who sits at the hearth in the firelight , spinning purple yarn marvellous to see , her chair against a pillar , he maids behind here . 
My father�s throne rests against the very same pillar , where he sits like a god and drinks his wine . Stride by him , and throw your arms around my mother�s knees , if you want see the day of your return come quickly and joyfully , no matter how far away your home may be . if you win her favour , you may hope to see your friends , and reach your fine house in your own country . � / 
So saying she gave the mules a flick of her shiny whip , and 
they soon left the flowing river behind . 
They trotted briskly , legs flickering away , and she drove carefully so that 
Odysseus and the maids could follow on foot . as the sun was setting 
they reached the famous grove , sacred to 
Athene . 
There , 
Odysseus quickly sat down , and prayed to the daughter of mighty 
Zeus : �Hear me , 
Atrytone , child of aegis-bearing 
Zeus , and listen to my prayer , for you failed to listen when the great 
Earth-Shaker wrecked my raft . Grant I may come before the 
Phaeacians as one to be helped and pitied . � / 
So he prayed , and 
Pallas 
Athene heard , but did not show herself , from respect for her uncle , 
Poseidon , who would still rage wildly at godlike 
Odysseus , till he reached his own land . / 
So noble long-suffering 
Odysseus lay there , conquered by weariness and sleep , while 
Athene came to the island and 
city of the 
Phaeacians . 
They had once lived in broad

city , and ask for my valiant father Alcinous� palace . It�s easy to recognise , a child , a mere infant , could show you , for noble Acinous� palace is nothing like the Phaeacians� houses . / 
When the courtyard and palace enclose you , go straight through the great hall , till you come to my mother , who sits at the hearth in the firelight , spinning purple yarn marvellous to see , her chair against a pillar , he maids behind here . 
My father�s throne rests against the very same pillar , where he sits like a god and drinks his wine . Stride by him , and throw your arms around my mother�s knees , if you want see the day of your return come quickly and joyfully , no matter how far away your home may be . if you win her favour , you may hope to see your friends , and reach your fine house in your own country . � / 
So saying she gave the mules a flick of her shiny whip , and 
they soon left the flowing river behind . 
They trotted briskly , legs flickering away , and she drove carefully so that 
Odysseus and the maids could follow on foot . as the sun was setting 
they reached the famous grove , sacred to 
Athene . 
There , 
Odysseus quickly sat down , and prayed to the daughter of mighty 
Zeus : �Hear me , 
Atrytone , child of aegis-bearing 
Zeus , and listen to my prayer , for you failed to listen when the great 
Earth-Shaker wrecked my raft . Grant I may come before the 
Phaeacians as one to be helped and pitied . � / 
So he prayed , and 
Pallas 
Athene heard , but did not show herself , from respect for her uncle , 
Poseidon , who would still rage wildly at godlike 
Odysseus , till he reached his own land . /
