# OdysseusForMaven
### Maven implementation of the original project Odysseus

  Odysseus is an <b>alignment and comparison tool</b> for Greek and French corpora. This version is specifically built for Maven libraries.
  
  With Odysseus, you can compare several multilingual translations of Homer's <i><b>Odyssey</b></i>, check word frequencies for specific sequences, syntactic proximity and distributional semantic proximity.

  It is specifically implemented for Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, but users will see that very few changes are needed to adapt it to other corpora.
Such changes are still in the ToDos list but will be done very soon.

  You can add your own translation of Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> in the language of your choice in <b>plain text</b> format.
  The output is a folder of aligned XMLs built for our alignment visualization tool in JavaScript, <b><a href="https://github.com/OdysseusPolymetis/paralogos">Paralogos</a></b>, but as some of our texts are still copyrighted, you may want to write an email to marianne.reboul@gmail.com to get access individually.

  The online interface is available <a href="https://odysseuspolymetis.github.io/paralogos/">here</a>.
