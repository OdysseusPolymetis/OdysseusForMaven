# OdysseusForMaven
### Maven implementation of the original project Odysseus

Odysseus is an <b>alignment tool</b> for Greek and French corpora. This version is specifically built for Maven libraries.

It is specifically implemented for Homer's <i><b>Odyssey</b></i>, but users will see that very few changes are needed to adapt it to other corpora.
Such changes are still in the ToDos list but will be done very soon.

You can add your own translation of Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> in the language of your choice in <b>plain text</b> format.
The output is a folder of aligned XMLs built for our alignment visualization tool in JavaScript, <b>Paralogos</b> (also available on github).
